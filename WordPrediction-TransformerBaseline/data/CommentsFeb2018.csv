As Kristof points out we will all be better off if women's equal contributions were equally valued -- it is not a zero-sum game (if I win, you lose) it is the reality of rising tide lifting all boats. <br/><br/>I'm glad we (women, and some men) have gotten angry, perhaps angry enough not to 'take' inequity any longer. The huge progress some claim that women have made? There is a high water mark at 20%. In spite of women being better educated than men ... for 30 years (more BA and master degrees since 1987) women's participation in our economy has been stuck at 20% or less: Congress (20%), Fortune 500 board directors (20%); professional chefs (19%); Corporate C-suite (18%), nominated for last six Grammy ceremonies (9.3%); CEO's (6%). In addition to getting paid 20% less for the same work on average, and much much less in male-dominated professions.<br/><br/>More than time to make the dictionary's definition of feminism a reality: that women have political, social, and economic equality with men. I wish that people would stop messing with the definition. It is not a campaign against men, it is a campaign for equal opportunity.

Rojava is very different in important ways.  First, its governance is linguistically, religiously, and ethnically inclusive and grass roots democratic.  Assad and Assad père forcibly took land from the Kurds in Rojava and gave it to poor Arabs from other parts of Syria.  Then, Rojavan Kurds, Yazidis, Assyrians and Arabs together fashioned, under the influence of the evolving political philosophy of Ocalan and forged in the twin crucibles of ISIS and the Assad despots, a defensive, a non-aggressive force concerned with keeping Daesh (ISIS) and other aggressors (like Erdogan, but definitely not all or even most Turks whether Kurdish or not) out of their towns and villages and desert regions.   Its governance includes folks from a range of different ethnicities—Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen and Assyrians—and religious groups including predominantly Muslims, Christians and Yazidis. It is feminist.  Neighborhoods, villages, towns have set up local democratic organizations. So second, unlike the PKK as first self-defined, though it too has evolved over time, the YPG/YPJ is a defensive force, protecting their own communities, like Afrin, and not looking for more.   They want to build a Rojavan that can offer a good future to their children.

Also, the Turks have stated they do not intend to maintain troops in Syria once they have cleared the Kurdish PKK/YPG terrorists and intend to resettle some of the 3 million Syrian refugees currently in Turkey onto land reclaimed from the PKK/YPG which had ethnically cleansed the Arab and Turcoman population in northern Syria to settle Kurds: <a href=""https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/"" title=""https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing-...</a>",25794639.0,25794639.0,<br/>,userReply,1517521921,2.0,False,25791730,Editorial,25791730.0,Karekin,25791730:25794639,https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png,22,1,,0,,Unknown,0,approved,1,0,Editorial,1517533254,EMIP,65314381.0,"Washington, DC",,

But the Russians certainly mean to do us as much harm as possible short of that scenario, and interfering in our elections has now become a major concern.

He grabs furtive moments with Putin at international gatherings without an interpreter or any other person listening in probably to assure him that he's working on reducing sanctions. Even when Congress passes a sanctions bill with a veto-proof majority, Trump says he will not  enact the sanctions--he will not apply the law. He's being blackmailed.

And why would DJT insist on putting this word in the release?<br/><br/>The answer to 1. is that adoptions are directly related to the sanctions that the US imposed against Russia after Pres. Obama signed the Magnitsky Act into law in 2012. This allowed the US to seize the assets of Russian human rights violators and their direct relations. Putin responded by banning the adoption of Russian orphans by American families. It was a callous maneuver. The goal was to punish sympathetic Americans and perhaps get the sanctions lifted. But that didn't happen. Since then they've been expanded, Magnitsky's name graces a global sanctions act, and while the admin is wishy-washy on enforcement (I wonder why?), they're here to stay.<br/>In other words, ""adoptions"" are Kremlin shorthand for ""sanctions against Russians,"" many of whom are Putin's friends.<br/>The answer to 2. is much more mysterious, but it absolutely, and plainly, lays out a possible quid pro quo. We'll talk Clinton dirt if you talk ""adoptions"" should you win. Remember, adoptions=sanctions. Period. Oh, and we can help with the winning thing.<br/>Why would DJT insist on adding this word? It sounds so innocent. But it isn't. Veselnitskaya probably did mention adoptions at the meeting, but again, she MEANT sanctions. Trump's adding it implies that he's fully aware of this.

An America that values itself for its own sake, not for the worth that its spirited, diverse immigrant-population created for all of us over the past century.<br/><br/>If we lose what was once our competitive advantage we lose our greatest resource — ourselves.

However, doesn't it bother you at least a little that virtually all economists agree that immigration is a net positive (many feel a strong positive) to the US economy?  Without a continuing flow of young immigrants, the US is in danger of becoming like Japan, with a rapidly increasing population of elderly people and an equally rapidly decreasing population of tax-paying workers.<br/>Your posting seems to assume that immigrants are very expensive to the country for a long time.  That's not necessarily true either.  For example, the immigrants who will be contributing the most in only a few years are those who are children now. A lot of their social support comes from their parents and even grandparents.  Many people in the US think that family life is an important part of helping youngsters grow into productive members of society.  Many experts on street gangs emphasize that such gangs are often providing a kind of substitute family when the nuclear family structure breaks down.<br/>Sue, it sounds like you are at least a strong supporter of immediate action to protect the roughly 1 million ""dreamers"".  Most of these are educated, are native English speakers, and are fully integrated already into US culture.

While I knew a lot of gay men and lesbians who didn't talk about marriage and equating their relationships with marriage (calling each other husband, or wife in the case of lesbians), I also knew a lot that did, not only in the 1990s but going back to the late 1970s. Admittedly, this was probably somewhat more common among lesbians than gay men, but it was not unheard of among gay men, especially those passed the boyfriend stage. Also, I know of a lot of couples who had commitment ceremonies and exchanged rings long before the Hawaii Supreme Court ramped up the issue in 1993.<br/><br/>The references make sense to me. Dramatically if not chronologically, it is Donatella who first accuses D'Amico of not providing a family, the one thing she says Gianni most wanted. Her point isn't that D'Amico can't do so but won't do so. We later learn, however, that D'Amico tells Gianni as they leave the nightclub that he does want just Gianni. In Miglin's case, ""pretend"" is the operative word. Because of his true, deep feelings for Marilyn and his sense of guilt, he hopes that he can pretend to be married to Andrew, if only for the night. Cunanan plays on this need, plotting all along to destroy the reality of Miglin's life. When he later kills the groundskeeper in New Jersey, he does so as the man is pleading to see his wife and son one more time.<br/><br/>As for Cunanan, the motivations of psychopaths are, generally speaking, psychotic.

I get to know them through their facial expressions,  gestures, and body language. Because they are also watching my expressions when I say something—in other words, they notice how I say things as much as what I say—my friends can detect deeper meaning behind what I say. We connect on an emotional level. I could be having an extremely terrible day, but on Facebook, I can hide behind my computer, pretending everything is fine, and my Facebook friends would have no idea. The internet creates a distorting filter where it is more difficult for people to understand one another on an emotional level because they cannot see each other. Online, we have to use a smiling emoji, but face to face, we can just smile. The emotions we express face to face are more impactful and memorable. We need to have a small group of friends that we interact with at the deepest level, the people that we touch, feel, and see face to face because those are the highest quality and last the longest. The quality of our friendships through face to face interaction is undeniably better compared to cyber-friendships forged through Facebook.

Real friendships are the people you can see everyday, hangout with constantly, forming a better bond. Nothing can replace the memories you make in real life. A text or video call is nothing like actually hanging out with a person and creating a stronger bond. As the related article mentions, “There is a sense of connection that comes from sharing one another’s burdens that is impossible to replicate with a ‘like’ or a tweet. Deep friendship requires an investment of time and energy, and that seems harder now that there are so many shallow, counterfeit versions of friendship that give us the false sense of being connected but lack any depth.”<br/>	Nothing can beat the bond of a real person that you can actually see in person and communicate in real time. Although, the internet and apps like snapchat have made my relationships stronger with people I don’t talk to often or get to see everyday, hanging out with them is much different. Being able to hear their voice, laugh with them, share the same meals, and hug them is so much better than any type of phone call or text.

As I move along the school system I have kept in mind that happinesses is the goal. But as time goes on, the end of the goal has been challenged with other aspects of the future. While talking to my peers about their life plans they have it all planned out, but so rarely do any of them focus on happiness. We see our futures as a tunnel that goes from school to college to job, but we never leave time for joyful moments. When reading about this class it made me realize that others also feel the same way as me. I personally hope that this class continues and that those taking it are able to see beyond the tunnel. Hopefully this is spread to children, we all need to understand that there is more to life than a successful career. Children are the future, and how can we expect them to create a happier world if they don’t even know what happiness is.
