1491062490,"As the husband of a Cuban refugee whose family escaped the economic and political desperation of Castro’s Cuba, I have watched the slow but predictable descent of Venezuela with sadness.  Chavez and now Maduro, adopting the Castro playbook, eliminated all power centers that could have resisted the dictator.  This included nationalizing industry, using thugs to intimidate the populace, shutting down or taking over the media, removing judges that opposed their policies, disregarding the legislature, rigging elections and arresting politicians who opposed them, all the while blaming the US for their problems.  The result is an imploding economy with high inflation, low savings, poor health care with no medicines, intense corruption, no political freedoms and increasingly tight government controls.  Note that this was justified in the name of the downtrodden and lower classes of society, who are predictably the worst off because they can’t flee the desperation.<br/>The Obama administration should not escape blame for being complicit in this downward spiral throughout its time in office and blew the last chance for the Venezuelan people when it failed in 2016 to back the democratically elected opposition’s legitimate (under the Venezuelan constitution) to recall Maduro.  Now we can only watch the suffering, which the Times has documented well, of the people and pray that somehow the government is overthrown and the rule of law and respect for democracy is re-instituted.

1491062490,"Somehow I feel modern dictatorship keeps the ruler's power in check in far more effective manner than modern democracy. The so-called democracy that is practiced here produces an illusion of rule by commons even when its underlying authority is purely plutocratic. The best part of this kind of democracy is that upon maturity, it distributes the responsibility of an ineffective government to its people, which in turn provides stability even if the government is bad. On the other hand, dictators are often solely responsible for their actions and consequences. Unlike in our so-called democracy, blame can be easily assigned in a dictatorship.<br/><br/>So long as the blame also has power - which it does - a dictator would actually care much more about his/her long term well being than either a direct vote of the majority (who cares more about short term interests) or an elected official (who cares more about public opinions than well being of the people - if he made a bad decision in accordance to public opinions, he's off the hook regardless of the consequences).<br/><br/>So how is a dictator's power kept aligned in the interest of the people? Foucault's ""governmentality"" might have some answer. The key point stressed by Foucault is that in our large modern nations, population itself is the root of all powers. The well being of a population, I believe, can therefore directly impact well being of the dictatorship - who is never off the hook.

Shades of the same are ominously playing out in Russia and in Hungary. Subversion of pluralistic democracy by non military left and right populist oriented parties is becoming a political trend. ,22002485.0,22002485,<br/>,comment,1491048702.0,1,False,0.0,,22002485,https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png,0.0,,0.0,,0,approved,1.0,0.0,1491053967,Vox Populi,75717905,Boston,,,0,58def9f57c459f24986d7c90,Unknown,Editorial,575.0,22,Editorial

1491062490,"@PAN, @robert blake<br/><br/>My point is that, while the sins of Gen. Pinochet have been widely aired in the leftist American (and European) press, those of Allende, Carlos Altamirano and other Chilean leftists have not. There has been a double standard in the reporting of Chile since the Sep, 1973 coup.<br/><br/>I also have Chilean friends, some of whom are ambivalent about Pinochet and others who actually liked him. If your friends were ""refugees"" from Pinochet, then possibly they or their parents were exactly the leftist radical militants who were trying to foment civil war and subvert the Chilean constitution.<br/><br/>The NYT has printed article after article by Ariel Dorfman, all of which are critical of Pinochet (fine), but none mention any of what I discussed in my earlier post. That is selective reporting of the worst kind, though what one would expect from NYT.<br/><br/>For example, such articles mention that after Allende received a 36.3% plurality in the 1970 presidential election, the Chilean Christian Democrats rebuffed CIA efforts to get them to not award Allende the presidency, a decision made by the Chilean congress in Oct, 1970. What Dorfman et al never mention is that six months later, the Christian Democrats realized that they had made a mistake. In other words, Henry Kissinger and the CIA accurately predicted what kind of leader Allende would be and the Chr Dems were completely wrong. And after the 1973 coup, former Chilean Pres. Eduardo Frei was glad Pinochet had undertaken it.

Apart from the obvious fact that UNC's administration and various coaching staffs knowingly violated (or turned a blind eye to) NCAA rules to their respective teams' advantages for over a decade, this article is timely because it's the second year in a row that the basketball team has participated in post-season play and reached the Final Four. The widely-held sentiment among other schools' fan-bases (and probably administrations and coaching staffs) is that virtually any other team would have at least received a one or two-year post-season ban by now, and perhaps even the so-called ""death penalty"" for such a period. This is not just a now-stale ""scandal"" to anyone other than those in the UNC community. It is a clear example of how certain college institutions are able to skirt the rules that should be equally applicable to all college institutions.

1491069547,"On a note unrelated to the ethnicity of Finns, I may be one of the few for whom the name MARA Wilson did not ring a bell, and I have seen ""Mrs. Doubtfire.""  On the other hand, ANASAZI was one of the tipoffs, for me, to the trick.  I did have PRICE before PRIZE, and it kept me from seeing the ending of ANASAZI for a while.  Then again, with LESIAS in place, IGLESIAS (both of whom are gimmes to me) was missing in action.  <br/><br/>Also, in some spots it seemed that the answer was too long; most would put BACON instead of RASHERS for the breakfast strips.

1492384252,"A terrific and insightful review by Mr. Brantley! Here in all its concrete emotional explosivness is the essence of what disgusts and is so destructive about classes in society. The staging by Stewart Laing is absolutely BRILLIANT! So brilliant, in fact, it might very well turn out to be the greatest theaterical experience of your lifetime.  The play abounds with his many spectacularly creative visual delights.  Bobby Cannavale, as always, is beyond superb. What a talent! He plays his role which calls for very demanding physical acting gloriously and delivers a magical performance.

It's difficult to find a more beautiful location anywhere, and as I write this, it's 28°C and sunny, so much for climate-dissing.

There's some variety happening, and that's a good thing.  Check back!  Even the suburbs are experimenting with their so-called regional town centres.  Surrey is literally carving out a new downtown with gorgeous buildings from Bing Thom (gone too soon), and Burnaby is getting pretty creative.  Prices are exorbitant, and I have no solution, but something has to give.<br/><br/>One final word about the Downtown East Side:  it is atrocious that people live like this in one of the world's richest countries.

I've never lived anywhere where these issues and potential solutions are so openly discussed.

I spoke both official languages and was a university graduate. I never expected the treatment I received in Vancouver. I was told they didn't want people like me; we just brought our problems to Canada. They proceeded to interrogate me at the airport (I had claimed refugee status). Since I was fluent in English, the immigration officials did not call social services, translators, or any other witnesses, and went to town on me. They basically did to me in Vancouver in 1988 what we nowadays call ""harsh interrogation techniques."" I remember as one point I was trembling so badly I could barely speak. After locking me up in a cold room for a long time, the interrogator told me I would either answer questions or they would put me away. I think the trauma of that 1st day in Canada was what motivated me to eventually leave Canada and become American.

Asking about this and other quaint features, I was told that ""Vancouver is a hick's idea of a big city.""

1491369438,"Vancouver proper (not the suburbs) has become a city for tourists, investors, and retirees, as the majority of comments attest. The crazy housing prices are more a symptom of the problem than the cause.  The problem is a total lack of economic depth.  The old industries—lumber, paper, mining, fishing— are a shadow of what they were. There are start-ups, as in many cities, but very few medium sized, established STEM companies, and no big ones.  Heavy manufacturing is close to non-existent. What there is is a fragile, life-style based service economy, providing crummy jobs without long-term prospects for attractive young people willing to live with roommates.<br/><br/>But the city has good universities, good recreational facilities, a progressive  vibe, and a tolerable climate if you overlook the really rainy years (like this one). Foodies are in heaven and the top of the upper middle class can still afford a home with a garden close to downtown.  If you have kids and a family income over $250,000 (at most 3% of the native population) you can just live here, but your kids, if they have ability and drive, will leave, because there are few good jobs. If the kids are laggards, they'll stay, in your house.

A 20 year real estate boom rocket-fueled by laundered off-shore deposits and massive liar mortgages (on a scale that would make Bernie Madoff squirm) does not make for great future economic stability. Huge numbers of houses on the traditionally affluent west side are empty, held as capital investments by off-shore groups. Small houses on the east side built cheaply 100 years ago on tiny lots as modest working class homes or for new immigrants, now can cost $2,000,000 or more and are being bought by two income professional families with massive mortgages.  But at least the east side is not empty.  Condos can cost as much as in NYC or London but, as with the west side house, vast numbers are held by off-shore interests as investments.  One benefit of the traffic choking bike lanes is that gridlocked commuters have lots of time each evening to look up and count the condo suites that don't have any lights on.

Vancouver is a lot like SF, but without the rain - isolated geographically from the rest of the nation, and as a result developing its own quirky sense of culture and eclectic influences from across the Pacific. My childhood view of the city, growing up in Chinatown and the Downtown East Side, is a markedly different vision from how writers like this portray it. My view was of a tough, grimy, largely one story high town with not a lot happening, and it astounds me the poetic waxing about this city that others write about. Of course as a child I took the backdrop of the North Shore mountains for granted; only in retrospect and on coming back do I see them afresh.  Or more, it is a vision of the city one only sees west of Main Street, and north of West Broadway - that is, of the largely privileged middle and upper class. My Vancouver was rather different from this, and closer to the dull banality overwrought with nature that Jeff Walls photographs show, for instance: <a href=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/77/c6/43/77c643bebf3c444ba77be52d2eef2280.jpg"" title=""https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/77/c6/43/77c643bebf3c444ba77be52d2eef2280.jpg"" target=""_blank"">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/77/c6/43/77c643bebf3c444b...</a>.

1491333779,"Those dismissing Vancouver as ""shallow"" or ""boring"" should take a long look in the mirror.<br/><br/>From a Vancouverite's perspective, it's patently clear that many of these comments are written by people who haven't actually lived here. The truth is that the city is what you make of it -- all sorts of different people living diverse lives in a diverse and thriving city. To say that it is ""shallow"" is to imply that you've taken a lazy approach to living here. If you expect the city to hit you over the head with some single and overbearing flavour, like a vacation resort, then you'll be disappointed. But if you take the trouble to get to know people and communities, you'll find a city very much alive. And it's hard to argue that it's not one of, if not the most beautiful cities on the planet.<br/><br/>Granted, the affordability issues are real. But who can blame those who can afford it from coming here from abroad? I certainly would.<br/><br/>Bottom line: You need to see Vancouver yourself to understand what the hype is about.

It is not just a matter of cost of living that is outrageous, but the quality itself. Vancouver strikes one as an anti-intellectual place that busies itself with real estate ruled by foreign investments at the expense of affordable housing, or basic public needs like a second subway line east-west. Not to forget navel gazing (they call it ""the best place on earth""), and all this unbearable body culture fetish (yoga, sushi, organic food, tattoos, drug culture, etc.) at the expense of genuine human connection. No wonder Vancouver is also dog city: pets are more valued than people. The social scene is quite puzzling, with its passive aggressive twist. No one here will be ""in our face"", like in any American city, while at the same time friendship comes as a rare currency. The best word to describe interactions is shallow, and the best testimony is the excess of politeness as a token of social defensiveness (really funny to observe). Vancouver is no Shangri-la, rather some pretentious city that has consistently failed to plan for the next step, or create a real, warm and benevolent local culture.

The politeness is shallow, and people don't have much interest for outsiders or being truly friendly.<br/><br/>It is hard to make friends and it is hard to afford to live. Vancouver has become so expensive (not just buying, even renting) that crowds will show up for open house rentals.

And not by choice. <br/><br/>Finally, the city has a heavy Asian influence and it affects the food scene. I truly believe that most restaurants have to appeal at least somewhat to Asian tastes or charge high prices to succeed, and that is why there is no ""street food"" scene here.

1491686142,"All of this sanctimonious finger-wagging about Vancouver's troubled neighbourhoods is a bit much.  The proximity of these neighbourhoods to heavily touristed enclaves is the only reason it gets the level of attention from visitors that these comments serve to illustrate. The areas are no more dangerous or offensive to the eye than those that exist in many cities, particularly port cities, in North America and the rest of the world. <br/><br/>The most marginalized citizens of Vancouver have been living in this very small geographic area for generations. It's not their fault, nor should it be an indictment of the city as a whole, that they live in one of the most expensive and touristed cities in the world, within a stones throw of cruise ship terminals and cobbled streets lined with high-end furniture boutiques. <br/><br/>The concentration of troubled human beings and those who prey on them into such a tiny area (it's a few square blocks) also serves to exaggerate the visual effect on visitors. This is not a Vancouver problem - drastic inequality, mental illness, drug addiction and homelessness are baked into urban environments everywhere.

This is also the fantasy of weak men without financial means who just happen to be in lesser positions of power - small business owners, managers in large corporations, college professors...the list is endless. <br/><br/>Like rape, harassment is about a power play manifested as sex. Unlike rape, harassment probably does not include physical violence because the perpetrator is not anonymous. That would be evidence. <br/><br/>One thing that is clear is bullying in America is not limited to the school yard. Unfortunately, it extends to adult behavior and men and women who embrace language characteristic of bullying are likely to be guilty of that kind of behavior as well.

And just because O'Reilly vehemently defended Ailes, slamming the women who came forward in the male dominated industry, we shouldn't assume they are birds of a feather. And I'm sure they'd never even consider choosing O'Reily, ratings and revenue over providing a safe, comfortable work environment for women. Nah, that's just crazy talk!

1491066429,"I am not sure what exactly Walsh meant by ""old guys... using mating strategies that were acceptable in the 1950s,"" because rape and coercive sexual interactions are not ""mating strategies"" at all. The only possible thing that can be said about these forms of assault to minimize the culpability of the aggressor is that perhaps he is mentally ill. A profoundly inhibited person with severe feelings of guilt around sex might feel that only by injecting aggression, the humiliation of the other party, does the 'sinfulness' of the deed become attenuated, since obviously a woman who would agree to trade career advancement for sexual favors ""must be corrupt, and therefore deserves what I will do to her."" These are not ""1950s"" ideas: they are pernicious tribalist, male supremacist views rooted in the notion that women, intrinsically, are inferior to males, made to gratify them in ways 'no normal man' would himself stoop to. Such thinking is a sickness. It precludes the possibility of any sincere attachment. Everything is about the pecking order, who someone is within a hierarchy of their own invention. For such predators, normal consensual interactions as equals with an independent partner are nearly impossible to maintain. Outside the bedroom, no surprises, these mentally ill bullies sow discord, nurture intrigue &amp; tend to impede others' productivity. O'Reilly should follow Ailes.

Powerful women like Hillary Clinton and Angela Merkel can cover up, as their power isn't derived from showing cleavage or knee, ie. when women have actual power they don't need to resort to attracting male piwer through sex. It's just so complicated, there are so many books and studies about this. I am just so disheartened to see serious women newscasters dressed in a way that draws attention to their bodies instead of their words and thoughts. It's demoralizing, and opposite to how I felt seeing Hillary in her lovely suits during the campaign. Sometimes when I 'm watching the news, I imagine the clothing switched and how we'd see the men if their legs were showing, their arms were bare, and they were in heels.

1491190830,"First off, ignore the people telling you to get a cat.  If you want a cat, great, but don't get a cat for this reason.  I had my own mouse issue.  I haven't seen one in years now.  Here's what I did:  First, you have to figure out how they are getting in. Typically, that is the same way they are getting out. So when you come home and turn on the lights and they scurry?  That is their exit.  Once you figure that out, you need to become a crazy person in terms of sealing up the holes.  My last place it was the gap around the radiator pipe (a typical entry area).  I steel wooled it shut and never saw him again.  In my new place, they had drywalled the back of my sink, but left a two-inch gap between that and the wall.  Once they finally came in and carved out the drywall (at my insistence), lo and behold was a hole in the wall behind the drywall the size that a normal sized man could crawl through.  These mice were just coming and going as they pleased  So no matter how many mouse traps I had, it didn't matter.  They just kept coming.  This is why I say traps don't work - you have to block the entry point.  So they sealed that.  Later, more mice.  there was another wall with a space behind it that they didn't see before.  So they sealed that.  At that point, I became a crazy person.  I took a flashlight and I went over every square inch of my apartment.  Any tiny opening, I closed with spackling compound and foam filler.  Not a mouse since.  You gotta close the door.

1491186488,"BAT won't work!  It is virtually certain to raise domestic consumer prices, for at least several years, and mostly on inexpensive items bought primarily by lower middle class and poor people.  It is unlikely to increase the number of domestic jobs any time soon.<br/><br/>Claims for improvements in domestic production jobs are unrealistic both in the timing and in the fact that the idealists ignore the certain reaction from our trading partners.<br/><br/>The extent of the reaction of our trading partners is hard to predict, but at the very least the 20% tax will increase the cost of low end consumer items by 20%.<br/><br/>The reason is clear and unambiguous.  There are few domestic manufacturing facilities to fill the gap when the BAT is put in place.  Moreover, corporations will only invest in new manufacturing facilities if they have high confidence that they can make a profit.  Only then will they START building the plants, buying equipment, and training workers.  That's a delay of at least 3 - 5 years.  In some cases, the 20% tax may not even be enough to justify the investment at all.<br/><br/>When our trading partners tax our exports, and they will, the overall effect on our economy could be even worse, with the loss of jobs from companies that export.<br/><br/>Jumping into the BAT by the Trump/Ryan clown show is not a solution to anything.

Republicans have thus invalidated whatever valid purpose a border adjustment tax might have.<br/><br/>Donald Trump has set his sights on one tax in particular: the Alternative Minimum Tax.

1491145883,"One of the major arguments for a border adjustment tax from those calling themselves economists, is based on a misunderstanding of the purpose and intent of value added taxes. Peter Navarro, Trump's National Trade Council director, argued recently in favor of the border adjustment tax ""We as an economy cannot succeed putting our people back to work in Ohio and Pennsylvania, Michigan and Indiana if those countries keep treating us unfairly with respect to that VAT tax system."" <br/><br/>Value added taxes are a form of sales taxes with specific procedures to insure that consumption is taxed but not sales of intermediate goods used in the production of goods intended for final sales to consumers. Their purpose is to raise revenue, any impact on trade is incidental. There is a winery in New York City. If a consumer buys a bottle of wine from it in New York City they pay 8.875% sales tax on it. New York does not collect any sales if the bottle is exported. When the New York sales tax was enacted, absolutely no thought was given to the aspect of the tax that may have promoted exports and discouraged imports.<br/><br/>A value added tax can give a country's exporters a boost. There is also a case to be made that taxing consumption rather than income promotes efficiency. The obvious way to alleviate the problem Navarro perceives as"" those countries keep treating us unfairly with respect to that VAT tax system,"" would be to enact our own VAT tax system...""<br/><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/4042715"" title=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/4042715"" target=""_blank"">http://seekingalpha.com/article/4042715</a>",22014552.0,22014552,<br/>,comment,1491142378.0,1,False,0.0,,22014552,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/6085/1424/cropped-60851424.jpg?0.009939605725084954,0.0,,0.0,,0,approved,1.0,0.0,1491145883,Lance Brofman,60851424,New York,,,0,58dfca3e7c459f24986d7d71,Politics,National,1488.0,1,News

1491107240,"Border adjustment (BA for short) is great idea and anyone who favors higher productivity and lower inequality should support it.  Productivity because the current proposal lets companies deduct investments in capital immediately and bans the deduction of interest payments.  Companies stop taking on pointless leverage and put more income into the investments that grow productivity, wages and the economy. BA destroys the incentives for corporations to shift profits overseas with tax code gymnastics that drive the citizenry who don't have white shoe law firms on speed dial up a wall.  Revenues go up because because companies stop hiding profits overseas.  BA won't make exports more competitive or make imports less competitive.  In the short term, the price of imports will rise.  But the lower price of tax-free US exports will raise the demand for them overseas. That will in turn raise the demand for dollars, which will appreciate the currency.  Importers who buy foreign-made goods with dollars will soon pay less and US exports will soon cost more.  Long term, no change.<br/><br/>To correct some points in other comments.  BA is not a tariff.  Tariffs fall only on imports, BA taxes US-made goods too.  BA is progressive, because companies can deduct the wages they pay.

This would upend over 80 years’ reliance on taxes at the place of production, which has been used by multinationals to avoid paying U.S. tax, and strip billions of U.S. profits into tax havens around the world. The border adjustment, in addition to other problems listed by detractors, would be easy to game – by domestic firms In Northern Idaho, farmers grow millions of dollars of soft white “noodle” wheat for shipment to Asia. To remove its corporate tax liability, a Lewiston company with $1 million in pretax profit could simply buy $1 million of wheat from local farms and export it. Over $1 trillion of commodities exported every year offer similar opportunities for domestic firms to avoid tax liability. <br/><br/>The border adjustment would not count export sales but does count the costs of those sales. A destination-based corporate tax (Sales Factor Apportionment, SFA) would raise as much extra revenue to substantially lower the tax rate - as border adjustment promises, but cannot deliver. Tax-avoiding opportunities would be removed by a properly written SFA. Thus the realistic goals of the House Republican plan can be achieved using a destination-based corporate tax without the flawed strategy of border adjustment. <br/><br/>Bill Parks<br/>208 874 3365<br/>bill@nrs. com ",22008539.0,22008539,<br/>,comment,1491091153.0,1,False,0.0,,22008539,https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png,3.0,,1.0,,0,approved,1.0,0.0,1491093962,Bill  Parks,68272948,Moscow Idaho,,,0,58dfca3e7c459f24986d7d71,Politics,National,1488.0,1,News

1491093910,President Trump is not a populist. He has filled his cabinet with wealthy elites. His health plan would have damaged many of his most strident supporters. He has overturned many regulations that were put in place to protect the common man. His budget plan is a disaster for the working man/woman. He spends millions on himself and his entourage for additional security and travel to his resorts. He and his family have done little to avoid conflict of interests in their business enterprises. He deflects and lies enough to make a normal politician blush. He talks like a populist but look at his actions. Eventually his followers will come to the realization that Trump is everything that they hate about politicians. When his tax plan is finally presented it will show that most of the benefits will accrue to the top 1% and the lower and middle class will again end up holding the bag.

1491088593,"I saw the article by (I believe Mr. Jones, a CEO of an American company) that argued in favor of a border tax adjustment.  I answered as follows, but am still waiting for some feedback on an article on the same subject by David Brooks on consumption taxes:  ""Am I the only one, or is there not something big missing in David's analysis, namely, state sales taxes?  The ""consumption"" tax that we have in the U.S. is basically the state sales tax, plus parallel state excise taxes on specific products like alcohol and tobacco.  There is absolutely no way the states will give this up.  So, at the national level, any consumption tax (such as a national VAT) would have to be in addition to the existing state sales taxes.  That seems a real non-starter as well.  The idea of an additional ""border tax"" on imports is in a separate category and would essentially be another form of customs duties (tariffs), i.e., part of trade policy.  Tariffs (border taxes, customs duties) do go to the federal government and for the most part are passed on to final customers and thus have the effect of a consumption tax.  Here again, new border taxes are probably DOA in Congress, among other reasons for the prospect that they would provoke similar new import duties elsewhere on exported U.S. products, damaging our exports and jobs.""

Simply put a importer would not be able to deduct the value of imported goods from his income (for IRS) and as a result would be taxed on their value.

But in the USA this regressive tax will, if anything, be accompanied by cuts in social welfare spending.<br/><br/>As far as its effects on the import-export balance of payments go, anyone with an Economics degree would tell you that after a short period of time, there will be none at all.  The BAT will raise the value of the dollar against foreign currencies, so that the real cost to importers will not change, and neither will there be any net benefit to US exporters.

1491081637,"Trump and the rad-cons (radical-conservatives) have thrown the baby out with the bath water.<br/><br/>To wit: ""advisers see the provision as a critical way to bring about tax reform while protecting American manufacturers.""  The border tax idea is part of their solution to the perceived problem of multilateral trade deals they claim costs workers American jobs.<br/><br/>But here's a thought: Perhaps the problem of jobs lost due to trade deals is misdiagnosed?  Left unspoken by most/all politicians is their willingness to put into law everything corporations received in negotiated trade deals, while maybe-never legislating the worker/workplace protections that also were negotiated with the parties to these trade deals. TPP is a prime example. It's demonized almost universally, yet the actual agreement negotiated mandates signatories to address worker displacement.<br/><br/>The upshot is American manufacturers wouldn't need the kinds of 'protections' addressed in a border tax, if Congress would worry as much about employee welfare as they do about corporate welfare. Since they don't, workers are encouraged (by self-interested parties) to blame multilateral trade, to favor unnecessary taxes, while Congress whistles all the way to the banks to deposit their campaign donations.  Win-win for Congress playing employees off of employers. Washington has had an interest in maintaining the bizarre adversarial relationship between employees (ie Labor) and corporations.
