Trump was going to have a responsible spending bill, but it adds over a trillion dollars to the national debt and soaks the middle class and benefits the rich.  Trump was going to pull out of Syria, but that is an unknown.  Trump was going to bring the best people to work in his administration and over a dozen of them have been kicked out.  Trump was going to build an expensive wall with Mexico for which Mexico was going to pay, and now, if there is a wall, we will pay for it.<br/><br/>So what makes you think that any reset negotiation that Trump would have with Iran would have anywhere near an ideal outcome?

1524595165,5adf341f068401528a2aa5e8,1233.0,"     I’m concerned that the author was too aggressive in terms of how she interpreted her results.  It’s true that she finds measures of economic hardship to be uncorrelated with Trump votes.  Two things complicate the interpretation of “status” as being more important than economic hardship.<br/>     First, people often answer surveys in ways that preserve their self-esteem.  This is especially true on surveys of people’s financial conditions.  In the 2017 Retirement Confidence Survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 79% of people reported feeling very or somewhat confident about their ability to have enough money for a comfortable retirement.  Yet, a recent study by Fidelity found that half of Americans may not be able to cover basic living costs in retirement.  Thus, people tend to provide self-serving answers to questions about personal finances.<br/>     Second, the measures of “status threat” could simply be proxying for economic hardships.  If people are show self-serving bias, they are likely to blame external forces like China, trade and immigration for their own economic hardships.  The author doesn’t explore this possibility either in the paper or in the supplemental materials.  The relationship between the “status threat” variables and the economic hardship variables is undoubtedly complex and needs more attention before it can be concluded that economic hardship doesn’t matter.

Refusing to enforce federal immigration law does is not equivalent to denying equal protection of the law to black citizens (see George Wallace). The U.S. Supreme Court has said the states cannot be commandeered into enforcing federal statutes. (See Prigg v. Pennsylvania [states can have legislation to prevent state officials from assisting in the capture of escaped slaves even if federal law says federal agents can capture them]. California is likewise under no obligation under its sovereign authority to aid the federal government in capturing illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>Equal protection is different and does apply to the states under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A state is bound by the 14th Amendment (unlike federal immigration statutes). Prohibiting black students from attending a state school would deny equal protection of the law and is in direct contradiction to the 14th Amendment.<br/><br/>I'm a California voter, but I am not ignorant about history or how federalism works.

Here in Michigan Trump won by .33% of the 94.77% of voters who picked Trump or Clinton. That's of the people who voted, not all eligible voters. President Obama won the state by 350,000 +/- voters while Clinton lost by 10,000 +/- voters. She received 300,000 +/- votes than Obama did. This result challenges the idea that there was a surge of racially based voting in the Midwest and goes to the more nuanced view that many of Obama voters simply didn't vote not that they switched sides because they suddenly became racists again.

However, we students are actual, real people, who have interests and beliefs and dreams. Inhibiting a student’s ability to express themselves in school is essentially silencing them, telling them that they are not actual people but just another face in society. Is that what people should be getting out of high schools? No. Expressing ourselves gives us the freedom to be who we are, and teaches us to be unafraid and unashamed of who we are, and we should not be learning the contrary in schools.

While schools do provide some opportunities for self expression, more can be done to expand them. One thing that most high schools have in common is that they have various activities for students to participate in. Those who love art can take art classes and join the art club, and others who are more on the athletic side dedicate themselves to training seven days a week to win a conference or state title. These extra activities outside of the regular school day, but still associated with the school, encourage students to express and be themselves. However in the classroom, I believe students ability to express themselves is limited. Often times all students are given the same assignment with very specific instructions including what color pen or highlighter to use a certain time. Limiting students to express themselves can be detrimental to their learning. Some students learn better and do better in school when they are given the opportunity to write their notes in different color pens, or even give broader  instructions for assignments.

Although there are many opportunities for students to argue and debate their opinions about certain school related topics within the classroom, there is really no opportunity for students to express their own “devotions, frustrations, little triumphs, and large peculiarities” in school. Teachers constantly allow students to debate among themselves about the school work, but almost never allow the students to express what they like outside of school or even talk about current events outside of school. Out of my three years at highschool, I have only had one class that actually discusses events that happen outside of school and talks about the impacts they have on people’s lives. I believe more classes need to discuss events that currently happen in society because it allows students to express themselves and their opinions on a variety of different topics while being part of the curriculum.

Kids and teenagers alike need to express themselves to their peers, their teachers, and their communities, especially when they aren’t accepted at home. A school is not only a place for learning facts - it’s a place to learn more about yourself and about how you relate to the world around you while being supported by people who care (why else would a teacher choose that job?). Allowing kids to learn these skills and supporting them as they do so yields adults who know how to bring passion into their lives - even if they have a 9-5 job they’d love to quit. Of course there are teachers who love to see kids grow and figure out how to be themselves in a safe, joyful way, but so often our need to meet a certain standard or rubric leads us to abandon our individuality.

My personal beliefs, values, and struggles, are very rarely incorporated into my work at school.

They're both unethical, narrow-minded, and both have inferiority complexes.  I've always said Trump has always proved that it is ambition, not intelligence, that makes someone rich and/or powerful.  Nunes and Trump are proof positive of that.  The thing that makes dumb, powerful, unethical people like Trump and Nunes dangerous is that, in most cases, dumb people are too dumb to know that they're dumb.  When a dumb person like Nunes is told by people in the military or in intelligence that his ideas make no sense, or are inferior solutions to a problem, he doesn't respect the wisdom or intelligence of people like Mike Rogers who are more experienced, knowledgeable, or brighter than he is.  His reaction, then, is not to re-examine his ideas, but to question the motives of those superior to him and to become paranoid.  This is common among mental lightweights.

Probably not in living memory, although the older, bigger, houses around the town were built by trawler owners in Victorian times.

When the fleet was shrinking a lot of the blame was passed on to Europe. But a lot of British towns and cities, especially in the north, got economically left behind the south east around that time, so it's not just one industry. But Grimsby is pretty isolated geographically, and outsiders make good scapegoats.<br/><br/>Two more quick points: the photograph of ""Grimsby's central shopping area"" was very selective!

Only radical adjustments in personal and communal priorities will correct the drift we are in. Its been nearly 50 years since the country rallied behind a radical idea (putting a man on the moon), and nearly 60 since a radical outcome in WH politics (gasp! a Catholic holding the presidency). Trump isn't a radical idea; he's the result of B613 (aka   shadow government) and a lazy (albeit with frightened voters) electorate. Pogo was right: We have met the enemy; he is us.

Characters at the beginning of the number should be changed in some way by the end of the song. In ""Surrey With The Fringe On Top"" in ""Oklahoma,"" Laurie is testy with Curley at first, but by the end of the song, she's asleep on his shoulder. The song moved the plot. The characters' relationship changed _because of_ the song. Modern shows like ""Come From Away,"" ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" and ""Hamilton"" are written by professionals who understand that the story doesn't stop for the songs. The songs develop the story.<br/><br/>Jukebox musicals feature songs that do not develop the story; they stop the plot. It is pointless to shoehorn a story into a collection of pop tunes. Therefore, it's no surprise that ""The Donna Summer Musical"" fails to entertain. I predict the exact same reaction for Broadway-bound vehicles: ""Ain't Too Proud"" and ""The Cher Show."" <br/><br/>Years ago, ""Beatlemania"" ran at the Winter Garden for years, arguably the first ""jukebox musical.""

Kelli Ward believes every word that Alex Jones utters on his show and tried to force John McCain out of the Senate immediately upon his diagnosis with cancer.  Martha McSally is an absolute Trump acolyte and NRA stalwart, amazingly serving in the district that Gabby Giffords previously represented.  The fact that Jeff Flake was not conservative enough to even get his party's nomination, before he started slamming Trump, tells you how extreme the Republicans have become in Arizona.  That Joe Arpaio would even dare run for the Senate tells you a lot about Republicans in Arizona these days, too.  <br/><br/>And Ms. Goldberg's reporting is spot on about the miserable state of public education in Arizona.

I commend Ms. Renkl for even acknowledging the inherent racism in Reinking's targeting of ONLY people of color in his killing spree, and the link to the ""sovereign citizens"" racist policies as contributors to his mindset. But, there's a chicken-egg element to his story that can easily conflate his racism and his mental illness. Which came first? The reality, though, is that this, like every other mass killing committed by white males in this country (the overwhelming majority of the perpetrators belong to that demographic), is an act of domestic terrorism. Had the perpetrator been Arabic and a Muslim, the word would have automatically appeared in every account of the incident in every mass medium across the country. That's an assertion backed up by a raft of historical proof. There would have been little rumination about the shooter's motives.

Based on what has been written about what he has said and /or done , this man could not have been confined for psychiatric reasons until he pulled the trigger.  The law states you have to be a danger to self or others to be confined against your will.  All of the delusions voiced were not enough.  And when the law allows his father to be handed his guns (I believe that's called a loophole) his father should have said ""No, he is not well.  I don't want to have that responsibility"". But he did not do that.  Instead, I imagine, he caved to his son's demands and gave him the guns to get his son off his back.  So what do we do?  We can either impose stricter gun laws (perhaps, in this case the individuall must be cleared by a psychiatrist and a court to get the guns back and not allow a parent to be the arbitrator).  Or, we pass confinement laws that allow people to be held against their will for their thoughts and for what they say.  Think that would be a good idea?  Well think about this: it would mean that confining you would be wholly subjective.  So anything, really, could be used for that purpose: getting angry at work when you are turned down for a promotion, being upset about something and muttering to yourself as you walk down the street, protesting the party in power, and so on.

The result is approximately 3.2 million individuals with untreated serious mental illness living in the community. Beginning in the 1970s in the United States, there began to be reported increasing incidents of violent behavior, including homicides, committed by these untreated individuals. Such incidents became more numerous in the 1980s and 1990s, and have further increased since the turn of the century. Existing studies suggest that individuals with untreated severe mental illness are responsible for at least 10% of all homicides and approximately half of all mass killings. Studies have also shown that when these individuals are treated, the incidence of violent behavior decreases significantly.

We have accepted that regulations, for the most part, are acceptable and necessary to protect our interests, safety, and liberty, whether those regulations apply to voting, food and drugs, or the environment. <br/><br/>Gun ownership has been a hallmark of America since its founding, primarily for reasons of need (e.g., hunting for food, etc) or safety. The notion of an armed “well regulated militia” was valid for a small, evolving nation in the 18th century. <br/><br/>For some time now, we not only have a large standing military, but each state also has a national guard which can be called upon as necessary. In the mid 20th century the Supreme Court’s Chief Justice called the NRA’s pursuit of unfettered gun ownership “the greatest fraud” perpetrated on the American people. Somehow, in 2007, that same body interpreted the 2nd Amendment much more loosely than ever before, though even that most conservative of Justices, Antonin Scalia, opined that the 2A did allow that certain types of weapons could be more stringently controlled. <br/><br/>I don’t oppose limited gun ownership, and have many friends who own firearms, though I do not. The NRA leadership have perverted both Constitutional intent, as well as more contemporary rulings. I doubt any responsible gun owners advocate mass murder.

But the most popular attitudes were favorable towards secular government, freedom of conscience, and literacy for all.

Also, some activities such as real estate are tax-advantaged. Democrats on the other hand would like to give too much to those who do not pull their weight and do not put in enough effort.

Unfortunately, Paul, this is too often little more than one step forward after two (or several) steps back.  Progress, it is not.<br/><br/>Oklahoma is a prime example.
