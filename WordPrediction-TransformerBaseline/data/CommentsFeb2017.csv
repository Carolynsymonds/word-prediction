Demonstrate how ""having opinions"" sans skills and knowledge is the gateway to lifelong penury.

He can -- a comic of the type he is supposed to be in the film. BTW, the complaint that his character is more sour/bitter than funny misses the point. Jackie Burke (the character DeNiro's playing, is basically a sour, even bitter guy who can be/and at times is fairly (but not hilariously) funny in just that mode (e.g. the scene at his niece's wedding). But then his character shouldn't be hilariously funny or he wouldn't be who Jackie Burke is -- a 74 year old who made it big on a sitcom for a while many years ago and who exists in the minds of those who remember him at all only as the character he played on that show.<br/><br/>P.S. the complaint that DeNiro's character is patronizing toward women is absurd. Of course he is -- given his age, background, and temperament, how could he be otherwise? If he hadn't been edgy and hostile in that cable TV confab scene, his character and the movie as a whole would have had no dramatic credibility.

De Niro shows up and does a solid job, but it seems the filmmaking lets him down. <br/><br/>I've seen just about everything this actor has done (much of it during the summer I decided to abandon my dissertation). The point is, in an emotional slight of hand, for a few months I transferred the research skills used for my dissertation to examining this actor's career.  In one of the few interviews available at the time, in reference to the intensity with which      De Niro attacked his roles, I believe he was quoted as saying something like, ""I won't always be doing this."" I took this to mean that he had chosen not to continue immersing himself so seriously in role after role after role.  <br/><br/>He also said his future was in directing. De Niro directed two great films, The Good Shepherd being the better and totally underrated one. I wish he had continued in that direction.  <br/><br/>Still, as a dedicated fan, I am not giving up.

What kind of leader threatens an act of war with a friendly nation that shares thousands of miles of border with us?<br/>Yesterday, a member of the Canadian parliament, infuriated by Trump's executive orders, publicly callled him a ""fascist"". Canada, a soft spoken nation who helped save many of our diplomats during the Iran hostage crisis, has never publicly even criticized us but instead has stood and fought along side us for generations. To quote trump in a different context, until we find out ""what the hell's going on,"" let's not make any more enemies out of our friends.""

They can blame Trump and democrats for everything that goes wrong, and credit Pence for anything that goes right. Pence is much closer to the philosophies of the new right led by McConnell and Ryan. Like they did with the shameless opposition to President Obama, they are playing it for the long run. They want the next generations to grow to their image, secure state and federal majorities, while working at county and city levels.

The country is in this box because of a distinction that Harry Reid failed to make in changing the filibuster rule.  Executive branch nominees should be confirmed with a simple majority: they are nominees of an elected, term-limited official and serve at the pleasure of the president and thus are effectively term-limited.<br/><br/>Confirming judicial nominees to life-tenured positions by a simple majority is unwise.  It can create or further the appearance that the judiciary is a partisan branch, thus undermining confidence that the courts deliver justice.  It encourages the legislature to default on its responsibilities and to allow the judicial branch to function as a supreme legislature.  <br/><br/>Democrats should propose both a law and a constitutional amendment that would advance the country's interest in having higher public confidence in the judiciary:<br/><br/>All nominees for Article III judges must be voted upon by the Senate within 120 days of the nomination and the votes of 55% of senators are required for confirmation.

A better argument begins with the Republican’s reason for refusing to consider Garland: the nominee of a lame duck president would not reflect public will.  So public will: a solid majority of voters in the presidential election voted for Clinton, and majorities support gun control, abortion rights, campaign finance reform, and public policy addressing climate change.  Given these facts, opponents of Gorsuch have a strong case that Trump owed the public at least a moderate pick, a unifying gesture that people across the political spectrum could agree is beyond Trump’s personal and political sensibilities.  This argument might resonate with enough moderate, by temperament at least,  Republican Senators—whose opinions regarding the issues listed above reflect the public will—to avert a change to Senate rules, allow a successful filibuster of Gorsuch, and force Trump to make a more moderate choice.

He holds a strict originalist interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, as the Founding Fathers would have intended it 230 years ago.  These are the basic beliefs also held by Justice Scalia.  That, in any case, is the theory advanced in pundits’ commentary since the announcement of the Gorsuch nomination.  A review of history strongly suggests that in practice Judge Gorsuch should not follow Justice Scalia as his standard.<br/>Since its creation by Article III of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has handed down decisions that have shaped American history. As “the court of last resort”, the Supreme Court has the final authority to interpret constitutional questions and federal law and to uphold or reverse decisions made by lower courts. Justice Scalia was an inevitable, but unintended, consequence of this authority. A brilliant but shameless sophist, he oftentimes made his case with spurious arguments, ignoring factual evidence to the contrary. Conspicuously, he invented “originalism” to deny others the right to interpret the Constitution while retaining that right for his exclusive and exploitative use.

Democrats would be well advised to read John Dean's books, Conservatives Without Conscience and Broken Government, and just for added emphasis, his book Worse Than Watergate.  This party bears no resemblance to the former GOP - with whose ideas I never agreed, but they, at least, were generally prepared to engage with comity and civility, and to put the welfare of the nation ahead of party.  That is long gone, and the Democrats are still carrying a torch for what has been trashed and gutted by an entire party populated by poisonous, power-mad nihilists and thugs, who had no compunction about denigrating our President for 8 solid years and obstructing everything he tried to do for the nation. They have no interest in helping struggling workers, the poor, the elderly, or anyone else, and their reckless disregard for our fragile planet threatens everyone and every creature on earth.

The repubs demonized unions and government employees to pit one middle class group against the other. The European response to the financial crisis was austerity and the US had its own version of austerity after 2010. The austerity policies in the US and Europe upped economic hardship for middle income people, upped left-out feelings, and added to the rise of nationalism. The repubs used gay marriage, civil rights, feminism, the debt, and gun rights to distract middle America while repubs moved wealth from the middle class to elites.  If the mean income had kept pace with the upper quartile in the last 40 yrs, it would be about $77K now. If middle Americans were earning those wages, I suspect there would much less interest in nationalism. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren appeal across many social/economic lines, the dems need to follow their example.

I lived in Idaho (yes, that Idaho) and was hosted by a family with Mormon faith.  In retrospect, those 10 months left me a profound impact culturally and socially.  I benefited enormously from the 10-month program under which I attended a local public school not only linguistically but also politically and socially. It is these values learned 15 years ago that are still greatly influencing my values and thinking at present. The time in Idaho made me appreciate so-called American values and propelled me to study at Indiana University with a major in political science.  While the Chinese student featured in the story confessed their struggle making  American friends and intensification of their national pride, so was my case. But eventually, I have grown fond of and appreciative of the role the U.S. plays in setting a benchmark for other nations to follow for areas of politics and governance, especially in the separation of power and freedom of press that many Asian nations, not to mention China and South Korea to some extent, still struggle to fully adopt. I am positive that many of these young Chinese students will return home with similar  kinds of appreciation for the U.S. that it has opened them with a new perspective to widen their view as was my case.

I found your entire comment troubling but I decided to dig deeper into your claim. <br/><br/>I found a nice slide-deck that explains how public school funding working in Michigan from someone in the Senate: <a href=""http://www.senate.michigan.gov/sfa/departments/datacharts/dck12_schoolfundingbasics.pdf"" title=""http://www.senate.michigan.gov/sfa/departments/datacharts/dck12_schoolfundingbasics.pdf"" target=""_blank"">http://www.senate.michigan.gov/sfa/departments/datacharts/dck12_schoolfu...</a><br/><br/>Per-pupil funding in Michigan comes from tax sources from everyone in the entire state, which mostly consists of sales tax, income tax, and property tax. These foreign students spend money at local businesses, in which they pay sales tax on goods bought, as well as the companies that pay tax on the earned income. These foreign students must also live in a home, most likely within the district, so they are in a home that pays property tax every year. So since these foreign students are paying taxes, don't you think they should receive some benefit from the taxes they paid on top of the $10,000 tuition to the school?<br/><br/>If anything, I think the better reason to be upset is that it does seem that the school is double dipping, getting both the per-pupil funding and the foreign payments for tuition. I personally like the competitive aspect of it between school districts, and also I think the additional dollars are needed at a time when Michigan is seeing large budget deficits, and so I really respect the Superintendent of Oxford schools for thinking outside of the box.",21361587.0,21361587.0,<br/>,comment,1486227016,1.0,0,0,Magazine,0.0,,21361587,https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png,40,4,,2,,Unknown,0,approved,1,0,1486242602,Kurry,67685107.0,"New York, NY",,,News

About fifteen years ago, as a teacher in the Seattle area, I started seeing kids moving from Korea and China to the top-rated high school where I taught.

Many of these folks weren't homeowners and didn't plan to stay and become taxpayers in the future. It was a scam that was effecting the amount of money dedicated to the kids of those who were paying.<br/>The second issue comes with higher ed. Schools like the University of Washington no longer take the B average students. They hold spots for foreign students who pay much more for tuition instead of giving them to state kids. I'm sure it helps subsidize some good programs but Washington State taxpayers help subsidize those programs, too.

A dorm for international students at public school systems is a horrible idea because it isolates them even more from American students. Because there are so many Chinese students on American campuses, they do tend to form an enclave to themselves and many after 4 years of grading college, still have trouble speaking English or having a good grasp of American society. This, of course, isn't true for all Chinese (or international) students but it is unfortunately true for a large portion.<br/><br/>I absolutely understand the frustration of American parents but it seems that their anger is misplaced at Chinese students rather than their local, state, and federal government. Public (and private) schools want Chinese students because they do pay full price tuition, which is often used to subsidize the cost of American students. Public high-schools will cost an international students anywhere between $20,000-$30,000+/academic year depending on the city. Because state and federal funding for K-12 and higher ed has never gone back to the level it was at before the recession, public school systems in particular are relying on Chinese students to offset the cost for their American counterparts.

We've had many foreign young people in our home in the past as au pairs and through exchange programs such as CISV. Nothing was more disappointing and frustrating to us as hosting these students. Unlike previous visitors, they seemed to have very little motivation and showed very little persistence in establishing meaningful relationships with peers at the school or in our home. They followed house rules only if it suited them, and socialized only with each other, constantly, through applications like facetime, even in the bathroom.  Despite this, they expected us to solve their problems and give them rides like an on-call taxi service. Separated from their parents to attend English language boarding school, they seemed to have little respect or patience with parental authority and were clearly from wealthy families where they were coddled. While I think that they could really benefit from cultural exchange, the current system doesn't foster this at all. The private Catholic school they attended charged them an exorbitant tuition, but didn't give them benefits it gave all of the other students (free laptops) or provide any additional language support.

Some of the students I interview for MIT don't make the cut because they just do what their parents tell them, even though they do it extremely well. They are often miserable nervous wrecks. I have observed that some later generation Asian and most Indian parents raise children with a little more flair and independence, and they are more successful in life and at MIT because of it. Also, there is a component of Chinese culture that values 'face' over truth; never a good idea in a business setting or in academia. Lying, even to save the other person's face, is a trust buster.

Our brain is constantly seeing the bad side of things because of all the hate and stress we receive as an individual. We begin to think that we have no purpose in our life because that’s what our society has lead us to believe. We begin to see ourselves as useless, but that’s quite incorrect. We are the next generation of intelligence. We will be the ones to find out how to solve a worldwide problem, the ones who might become President one day, the next to save lives. We have purpose, but that might not happen if someone doesn’t do something. The negativity that we face every day are making those chances slimmer and slimmer. Suicides happen every day, worldwide. But everyone is so committed to hiding their pain that no one seems to notice. Depression seems to be the thing for us teenagers now a days. You can’t scroll through social media without seeing someone posting a sad quote or threatening to end their lives. The more we read those things the more we are accustomed to becoming similar to them. We could put a stop to this if we tried. When someone does this, you try getting them to stop. Text them and ask if their okay, see them in person, anything could work but trying to endorse suicide would not. We are the future, and we have purpose, but with everything going on we could also be the end.

The affects of those suicides brought people together to fight for a better cause, saving the teenagers left from suffering a similar fate.

It all started with a simple group Jasilyn formed where “They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California, where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives.” I would have never thought that an action made by a group so small could later make such an impactful move such as helping the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Girls are exposed to images of women that don’t represent them, and are therefore more prone to eating disorders and body dysmorphia. Some people think that women are not suitable for politics because they think that they will make rash decisions due to their menstrual cycle. Girls are sexualized at a young age. Yet, when they finally feel confident in their bodies, they are called numerous demeaning names. Girls are taught that the only way they can find happiness is in not in themselves, but in a man. I often think about the injustice we face and how if we were men, our lives would be easier. However, I then think about the issues that men face as well and realize that they can’t be ignored. The hyper masculinity that boys have to live up to every single day of their lives since the day they were born upsets me. From the second they breathe their first breath, their favorite color has to be blue and they have to live up to the idea of what a man should be. The moment they step away from the mold of what a “man” is, they are called gay. If they cry, they are told to “man up.” Men who have depression are more likely to resort to violent behavior, drugs, and alcohol.

But that church does not espouse political opinions. Our Head of State and head of the  Church of England - the Queen -  has no declared political opinion. Individual ministers do often express there views, some very vociferously. I endorse that.. they speak as individuals.  There is something ominous about churches becoming politiclsed.  It produces a power base that anyone can seek access to with a view to determining its political stance on any issue. It's financial resources can be used to further or appose a political stance.  The church becomes a power base detracting from it's very purpose as a church . The church does not belong to any one person.. it belongs to the god it believes in and my little reading on gods seems to point towards spiritual fulfilment and not dictating anything except the observation a set of standards or commandments of behaviour.  Its concern should stay with matters spiritual and not whether to propound block borders or  holy wars against invisible opponents. Let their ministers from the lowest to the highest  speak out - for themselves as individuals on the good or bad of the society they live in.

If a church actually does charitable or community valued work, they should have a financially separate charitable entity for which contributions could be tax deductible.

Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the leadership began engaging in all manner of corruption and abuse – including swapping wives, incest, rape, theft of tithes and offerings, pitting people against one another, using things from private counseling sessions to blackmail, intimidate and publicly destroy people. When the abuses came to light, they used the money we’d given, as well as their power, to attack and sue anyone who stood up to them. They regularly dismissed the separation of church and state as a tax-exempt religious organization by inviting politicians to come speak, suggesting in not so subtle ways that we vote for these candidates.

Paul did not write letters about Christians mobilizing political forces so Christians could obtain better protection or benefits from Caesar.

If you believe the Bible then you know your savior came and it was not Trump. We never needed Reagan, the Republicans or others to ""save"" us or Christian values.
