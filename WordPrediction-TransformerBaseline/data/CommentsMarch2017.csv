In these times when many just read headlines, this one would given such a reader no understanding of this man and his purpose.  Many papers now give the projected time needed to read articles ( 2 min. read; 3 min. read), there is no longer depth to reading or to purpose.  While this article brings a little more attention to David Buckel, it does not do justice to Mr. Buckel's concerns, the choice he made, and the purpose.  Just as this paper is paying tribute to all the women they overlooked in their obituary columns for the past 100 years, they are continuing to overlook this man, his work, and his death.

The subtext is the need to stop tar sands oil altogether. The govt of Canada is solidly on the side of AB. Getting oil - even the filthy oil of the tar sands -to market is critical for Canada's existing economy. Yet it is also clear, to anyone with eyes, that the tar sands are an environmental disaster that must be limited if not shut down - not doubled in size, as AB hopes to do. In Canada, the tension is between doing what is ""good"" for the economy - at least, in a very narrow, myopic sense - and doing what is morally right and environmentally necessary.

In reading the comments posted here that focus on the “mitigating factors” like Mr. Buckel’s health or mental state, and the “futile” or “irrelevant” nature of his act, I'm reminded of similar responses to strong protests.   In February, the Times Magazine published an essay about the Valve Turners, a small group who planned and executed a symbolic turning off a valve of the Keystone Pipeline.  The essay carefully portrayed the protestors as admittedly humans with flaws and inconsistencies, but utterly thoughtful citizens diligently following their deeply held convictions.  Nevertheless, the same critiques appeared:  e.g., unstable persons, futile actions.   In 1846 Thoreau refused to pay the poll tax to protest slavery and our war of aggression against Mexico.  His close friend Emerson (and so many ever since) complained  of Thoreau’s irrationality and the uselessness of that act.  (Emerson, in time, came around to a greater appreciation of his friend's rebellion.)  <br/><br/>The lesson in each of these instances, I think, is to not rush to judge or explain.

There is an absolute direct line.

Put bluntly, the anti-Semitism in Europe today would be far, far less than it is if Israel did not exist. The cause and effect here are absolutely obvious; before Israel's creation and before the world's growing awareness of Palestinians, anti-Semitism in the Islamic world was only a shadow of what it was in the Christian West.

But the world has paid the price for that mistake for the last 70 years as the conflict has worked to disrupt the Middle East. The only solution at this point is a two state solution, but right wing forces in Israel have prevented it. So the world will continue to watch this human disaster slowly unfold, all underwritten by the American taxpayer. And maybe we will finally get that Armageddon that many believe is prophesy.

The Frenchman said that France was tired of being ""conquered and colonized"" by Africans. Quite an ironic statement, considering France's history of conquering and colonizing much of the African continent.<br/><br/>Similarly, Mr. Trump's relentless whining about how Americans are being treated unfairly and taken advantage of by the rest of the world takes a lot of goal, considering the history of pillage of third world resources by American corporations and the manipulation of their governments by our military, at the cost of thousands of lives, to support such plundering.<br/><br/>That Mr. Trump is unaware of such a history is not a surprise, considering the consistent lack of education of recent American presidents.

This is her central obsession. It's also blatantly self-contradictory and deeply delusional, yet the story completely passes this by without comment.

I believe we are nearing a tipping point in the American consciousness where the voices of reason and humanity, no matter how many or how loud, will be demeaned, ignored and then silenced and the ""movement"" Trump claims he started will rush headlong down the same nationalistic, war-making path that Nazi Germany took. The German people were not stupid people and most were ""good Christian"" people, but they bought in and fell in line. And we know the rest.

Besides, if Trump is going to start a war, I believe the war will start with or without the additional spending.<br/><br/>The real fight is with Paul Ryan. He has an agenda and it doesn't involve removing spending caps for vanity's sake. Ryan is a budget hawk with an eye for cutting anything not glued to the floor.

It’s not about “preening”, it’s about re-booting an America he remembers that held green memories for him and millions of Americans, not so green ones for those who were sidelined – all those hyphenates, for instance. For others who advise him, it’s more about China and Russia pushing the envelope and a radical Islamic terrorism (there, now I wrote it) existentially nipping at the West.<br/><br/>He’s gambling on 3%-plus economic growth largely to pay for it, and there ARE paths to that 3%.

1488399217,58b64f247c459f2525d1f17c,936,"Trump's inaugural address reiterated the theme that the day of revenge against financial elites has arrived. Despite this, the one certain thing that can be predicted is that the Republican controlled congress will enact and President Trump will sign is elimination of the estate tax. This literally could be called taking from the millionaires to give to the billionaires. Estates under $5.49 million are exempt from the estate tax. Billionaires are not as able as mere millionaires to employ various strategies to avoid estate taxes. Repealing the estate tax will give $billions to a fraction of the top 1%, which will ultimately have to be made up by the rest of the taxpayers. There is no doubt as to what Republican control of both congress and the presidency will be with regard to tax policy despite the revenge on the financial elites that Trump promises.<br/><br/>There will be a further shift in the tax burden away from the rich and onto the middle class.  Since 1966, there has been a tremendous shift in the tax burdens away from the rich on onto the middle class. Corporate income tax receipts, whose incidence falls entirely on the owners of corporations, were 4% of GDP then and were 1.77% in 2016. During that same period, payroll tax rates as a percent of GDP have increased dramatically from 3.27% in 1966 to 5.95% in 2016.

The Revenue acts of 1926 and 1928 worked exactly as the Republican Congresses that pushed them through promised. The dramatic reductions in taxes on the upper income brackets and estates of the wealthy did indeed result in increases in savings and investment. However, overinvestment (by 1929 there were over 600 automobile manufacturing companies in the USA) caused the depression that made the rich, and most everyone else, ultimately much poorer. <br/><br/>Since 1969 there has been a tremendous shift in the tax burdens away from the rich on onto the middle class. Corporate income tax receipts, whose incidence falls entirely on the owners of corporations, were 4% of GDP then and are now less than 1%. During that same period, payroll tax rates as percent of GDP have increased dramatically. The overinvestment problem caused by the reduction in taxes on the wealthy is exacerbated by the increased tax burden on the middle class. While overinvestment creates more factories, housing and shopping centers; higher payroll taxes reduces the purchasing power of middle-class consumers. ...""<br/><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1543642"" title=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/1543642"" target=""_blank"">http://seekingalpha.com/article/1543642</a>",21649484.0,21649484.0,<br/>,userReply,1488387522,2.0,False,21643979,OpEd,21643979.0,rjnyc,21643979:21649484,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/6085/1424/cropped-60851424.jpg?0.009939605725084954,31,0,,0,,Unknown,0,approved,1,0,Op-Ed,1488394703,Lance Brofman,60851424.0,New York,,

Tax credits and tax savings accounts are only useful for people in high tax brackets.  47% of the population pays no taxes and live from paycheck to paycheck.  Tax savings serve no purpose whatsoever to these folks.  Very expensive insurance is guaranteed for people with preexisting conditions.

He said NOTHING about the rash of anti-Semitism sweeping the country since Jan. 1 until forced to, and then only after once again, for the zillionth time, making it about himself. He still has said NOTHING about the rash of anti-Muslim bigotry. He said NOTHING about the murder in Kansas until a short reference last night.<br/><br/>All I hear are platitudes and generalizations.

The first is the unhinged madman of his rallies, where he eschewed teleprompters and actually tore one apart, and instead extemporized his unfettered, disconnected, immature, and wildly unstable id to all the unsuspecting dupes in his audience. The second Trump is the one seen last night, in the well of Congress, reading a speech someone else (Bannon, Miller) wrote for him, not understanding a single word of what he said, but acting like the Messiah come down from the Mount to save America from the teeming hoards of filthy, dangerous outsiders.<br/><br/>The point to remember is that Trump is ALWAYS the first version. No matter how smoothly he delivers his lies and propaganda, he is always the uncontrollable madman. At times, when a more civilized demeanor is needed, he dons his sheep's clothing and speaks in tongues to smoothtalk his listeners. But underneath this veneer, he is still the lunatic wolf, bent on devouring America. And the people be damned.<br/><br/>And yet the media rushes in to pronounce him ""Presidential"". Van Jones even wrote an article for CNN titled ""The Moment Trump Became President"". What he misses is that Trump never became President in the full sense of that word, nor can he. He is still the same misbegotten, lying charlatan of the campaign. He cannot change his stripes, no matter how well he reads someone else's words off a teleprompter.

Not being seen as obstructionist is important.  The opposition is best provided by demanding that the government start to deliver on the new jobs and better healthcare that was promised in the campaign.  Letting them off the hook by just objecting to everything is not the way to do it.  It's better to join with the voters and constantly demand results - results that are way more complicated to deliver than his political neophytes realise.

Who knew healthcare could be so hard? Well, anyone who was paying attention. As soon as the ACA passed, without any Republican support of course, the Republicans began attacking it, trying to insure that it would fail. This, like most of their 'contributions' to problem solutions in the Obama years, was entirely negativity, entirely obstruction. Now Republicans have the power, they have all the responsibility, and already they are trying to lay the groundwork for blame, when they cannot deliver their promises, back onto Democrats for ""being partisan and uncooperative"".

The GOP governors made sure it could not be successful by refusing to put it into place. So sorry, it didn't have  a fair chance as McConnell said it would not because of GOP opposition to anything Obama proposed.
