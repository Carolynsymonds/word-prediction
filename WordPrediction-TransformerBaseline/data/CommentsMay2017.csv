1494713997,"Thank you for this piece. Intersected with my own memories from about the same period when my late wife and I lived in Tianjin and I taught at Nankai University and she at a foreign languages middle school, first 1985-87, then 1990-91 w/ '88-89 summer back for shorter visits. Regular trips up to Beijing allowed us time to see many of the places you note. The area of  Ritan Park you describe was a favorite place. Even shortly after June 6, 1989 (I think in fact June 7-9) when we stayed at the Ritan Hotel briefly in the wake of the demonstrations and killings, the area brought a certain calmness that disappeared as we walked toward Jianguomen Wai DaJie. I appreciate your memories and sentiments.

Although I spent most of my time each trip in Hubei Province studying T'aiji at Wudangshan, each trip I arrived and departed from Beijing and chose to spend several days in the city. I always stayed in a hostel located in one or another hutongs on the west side. My favorite park was Yuetan where the Temple of the Moon is located. It's quite and very quiet - except most mornings between 10AM and noon a singer from the Beijing Opera performed with a small ensemble of Chinese musical instruments. It was fascinating, even enthralling. The entry cost was 10 Quai (about $1.65).<br/>As for the pollution there, it varied quite a bit. In early Autumn and Spring the sky was sometimes amazingly clear. At the end of November 2015 however the pollution was so thick that after we boarded our plane to leave for Seattle we were not cleared for takeoff for about twenty minutes.<br/>Beijing has riches, but it can be overwhelmingly bewildering due to its size and complexity.

The city was founded - not that long ago, certainly by Chinese history's standards - by nomadic non-Han people, mostly Manchus and Mongols, up in the northern grasslands and plateaus where 'they' (Manchus, Mongols) felt at home. It represents quite a stark departure - in location, vegetation and climate - from the long and ancient Chinese tradition of setting up the capital cities in the much more congenial South (e.g. Nanjing). <br/><br/>The weather alone says it all: Every September, local residents will remark cheerfully that ""Tianqi bu leng, ye bu re -- hen shufu!""

1494012037,"   Beijing as a microcosm of the Chinese universe, and for centuries its cosmological center, is a given by almost every author on the city, Chinese or foreign. Consider Wang Jun ""City Record,"" or Juliet Bredon's ""Peking."" The point that China had other, older capitals, is actually mentioned in the article, but isn't part of the article--it never said that Beijing is China's oldest capital.<br/>   The fact that Beijing was founded by Mongolians is irrelevant, as is the weather. What does matter is that it has been the capital of the place we now call China for almost all of the past 800 years. As for the south being more typical of where Chinese capitals were based, this is clearly wrong. Nanjing was a capital of China for a tiny amount of time (for one emperor at the start of the Ming and for a decade in the Republican era). The great historic capitals were overwhelmingly northern cities: Chang'an (Xi'an), Luoyang, Kaifeng, and, longest of all, Beijing.

1494120025,"Sorry. I have to emphatically disagree. Although Beijing has many nice days (and many bad days) pollution wise, it is very difficult to predict when air quality will be good or bad - making it difficult to plan a trip. In the 1980s, September and October were characterized by predictably beautiful weather so fall was the prime season to visit Beijing. Now, however, even September and October don't have predictably good air. One of the worst bouts of pollution I remember here in Beijing was a few years ago in late October. Spring is also not dependably good. Two days ago, the air quality index spiked to about 560 or so - far, far above what is acceptable by WHO standards. Summer tends to be fairly bad (muggy, polluted and still) and late fall and parts of winter are often polluted, too. Last December-January saw a stretch of 10 days or so of really bad pollution. In fact, bad air pollution is increasingly common from late October until the air gets really cold - around early to mid-January. So, yes, you can have a nice visit to Beijing if your roll of the dice turns out well. But it's also very possible that the 4-5 days you allot for your visit will be be during a stretch of terrible or merely bad pollution.

Look at the ridership on buses and you will notice how many of them are running half empty even during rush hour.

Riders complain that the wait for buses is maddening even when compared to the wait for trains.

1493649641,"Number of trains per hour (TPH) used to be 30 or more in rush hour on all major lines as far back as the 70's. Three things not tied into antiquated signaling have conspired to reduce this number:<br/>    (1) changes in passenger riding patterns - there has been a flattening out between rush hours and midday/weekends - fewer passengers in rush hours and more in the other periods.  Back in the sixties, large numbers of trains were routinely sidelined during midday and weekends because they weren't needed.  This probably made overall maintenance easier as equipment wasn't on the road as constantly.  Rush hours are just as crowded today but with fewer TPH needed, until now.<br/>    (2) Passenger behavior - the dwell time at stations has increased.  Observe how long it takes from the first time a conductor tries to close the train's door until it actually leaves the station.  Passengers know they can block doors with impunity and they will be reopened.  This needs to change in order to speed things up and increase capacity.<br/>    (3) Operator behavior - a series of operator-caused accidents over the years resulted in the elimination of routine ""keying-by"" of red signals, allowing trains to (slowly) get closer to each other, generally near stations in rush hour.  This, coupled with some maddening speed restrictions, further reduces capacity.

1493645907,"The main problem with the current signal system in the subway, is that much of the equipment is decades beyond its life span, and so it is prone to breaking down, which results in delays.<br/>However the solution the MTA is using to fix this problem is not to simply replace the equipment so that it doesn't break down. The MTA plans to completely change the whole signaling system in the subways. This despite the fact that putting in new signaling requires major long term shutdowns of train lines, it also requires new train cars and is way more expensive than simply replacing the old equipment.<br/>In addition when dealing with a problem such as delays, a plan to have it fixed by 2045 at the earliest, which means the problem will be going on for at least another 28 years, is no plan at all.<br/>Therefore a question that must be addressed is what exactly will be gained by going this route of installing this new signaling system in the subway.<br/>The sole benefit of a modern signaling system is that trains can run closer to each other. A line on the London Tube with its new signal system can run 36 trains an hour, as opposed to the NY subway which can run 29 trains an hour on a single line. However even with the current system the only line that runs that many trains is the Lexington Ave line during rush hour. No other line runs that many trains an hour.<br/>And since the sole benefit of this decades long project will be an extra 7 trains an hour on a single line, it serves no purpose at all.",22325881,22325881,<br/>,comment,1493643414,1,True,0,,22325881,https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png,55,,8,,0,approved,1,0,1493645910,Michael Stavsen,60905487,"Ditmas Park, Brooklyn",,,0,5906b3297c459f24986dd004,Unknown,Metro,2318,1,News

1493673683,"The thing in the photo is called a relay. Even the newer Automatic Train Control systems use relays. They are used to encode the logic for what a signal aspect should be, based on the inputs from the track circuits. The track circuits themselves are copper wired and in wayside signalling like in NY, are based on the concept that when the two rails are connected by a heavy object (a train), a circuit is made, reflecting occupancy in that circuit (which represents a section of track averaging 500 feet long, which can be from 50 feet minimum to 1500 feet maximum). In late 1960s era technology, this was done via audio-frequency circuits. One rail becomes the detector for occupancy within the circuit, between a transmitter at one end of the track section (also 50 feet to 1500 feet) and a receiver. Relays still handle the logic for the speed codes given.<br/><br/>Basically the signal maintenance people replace relays when they get beyond a certain age, because the wires deteriorate with usage (like any copper wiring). If the enclosure is not made any more, they can take it apart and put new copper wires in it. The contacts are gold and so they don't lose conductivity.<br/><br/>Very few places in the US use solid-state vital technology. One of them happens to be in the NY City subway: the Bergen Street Interlocking on the F line, which was the first solid-state interlocking in the US.

1493660452,"The main difference between London and New York is that gasoline is 4x as expensive there, and so everyone works in cities rather than more than half of people working in suburbs. The Underground is a first class system, i.e. only for people who can pay a very high fare. Everyone else takes the bus. The reason for this is that the Tube doesn't have the capacity to meet latent demand. So, lots of important people ride it, and they have high expectations. In New York, people who have money take taxis to work. Consequently the subway is seen politically as less important in NY. On the other hand, London has a difficult time doing the signalling upgrades - they've virtually bankrupted themselves trying to manage the projects.

1493738578,"The authors of the 14th amendment sought to settle definitively the troublesome issue of American citizenship.  The original Constitution does not list the requirements for citizenship, and most states asserted their authority to fill the gap for their own residents.  Justice Taney, however, tried to override this approach in the Dred Scott decision, by ruling that no African American could attain citizenship status.  The drafters of the 14th amendment repudiated this ruling in section 1, which stipulates that all persons born or naturalized in the US are citizens.<br/><br/>The Trump administration clearly seeks to circumvent the naturalization  part of the amendment, but there are many people in this country who would also  like to repeal birth citizenship.  Referring to cases in which pregnant foreigners enter the country to have their babies, to secure American citizenship for them, these critics paint a dark picture of a widespread conspiracy designed to undermine our culture or security.  This fear belongs to the same strain of paranoia that fuels support for Trump's anti-immigrant campaign.<br/><br/>Birthright citizenship sends a clear message to the world that the US does not define itself in terms of culture, religion, or a family's American heritage.

1493643430,"The word ""criminal"" does have a literal meaning, as Jason Stanley points out, but it is not a very precise one. A criminal is someone who commits a crime, but not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of contract and torts are violations of the law, but they are not usually considered as crimes.<br/><br/>What counts as a crime in a certain jurisdiction, at least in the technical sense, depends on the criminal code for that jurisdiction. In Canada, e.g., speeding is not a crime, it is provincial motor vehicle act offense. The state (i.e., the province) can punish those who violate such laws, but they do not count as crimes. E.g., mens rea is not relevant for conviction of a speeding offence. And the punishments are limited, usually consisting in fines or suspension of the right to drive. Otoh, impaired driving, i.e., operating or having care or control of a motor vehicle while  impaired by alcohol or a drug, is a criminal offense and can result in a lengthy prison term.<br/><br/>One of the difficulties in the US is that there is a confusing melange of federal and state criminal law.

1493677868,"I didn't make an argument for open borders, Dave. I said that philosophically, the conflict is between human rights--what are traditionally called ""natural rights""--and civil rights, which are limited to citizens. We're not getting the debate on immigration right because we're not distinguishing between the two. As others have pointed out, the perverse thing about the immigration debate is that it's in the interests of the ""haves"" who make the law to have cheap labor they can exploit. So the human rights of immigrants who lack the protections of citizenship are trampled in the name of profit.<br/><br/>To me it seems self-evident that if undocumented workers get work, somebody's hiring them because their labor is useful. These employers just don't want to pay citizens enough to make these often difficult jobs attractive. But it's the people most opposed to undocumented immigrants ""stealing our jobs"" who are also most likely to vote for politicians who don't support strong labor laws. This makes no sense to me.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not saying we should have open borders, but it seems obvious that we need this labor. So either our immigration quotas for certain countries such as Mexico are too low, or employers need to pay enough to attract citizens.<br/><br/>We need to understand the real conflict between the civilized artificiality of borders and the basic human instinct to migrate to a place where flourishing is possible.

1493681847,"C Wolfe, the point of all the cheap foreign labor is to undercut the wages of American workers. The wages of meat packers, for example, a generation ago were above $20/hour in inflation adjusted dollars. Now they're minimum or close to it, under atrocious conditions. The oversupply of cheap immigrant labor has not only undercut wages, but it has helped emasculate the unions.

This has added a great deal to the desire of citizens to want to get out from the perpetual austerity the EU through Germany inflicts on people.  Much the same has happened in the US as the Republicans refuse to allow the gov't to do things that it is well equipped to do like repair the decaying infrastructure in the US.  Zero sum politics have helped conservative parties throughout the West.  Populism as espoused by people like Trump is just a phony lie to play on voters baser instincts and ignorance.  Le Pen speaks of getting out of the EU which certainly has been gaining in resonance with the austerity driven endless recession in Italy and other places.  Le Pen uses immigration as Trump to argue that these people are ruining their culture.,22330457,22330457,<br/>,comment,1493655538,1,False,0,,22330457,https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png,4,,2,,0,approved,1,1,1493655560,c harris,63794670,"Candler, NC",,,0,5906e1f27c459f24986dd045,Unknown,OpEd,885,23,Op-Ed

One way to think about it is this: populism is not an ideology, it's a *style* of politics that encompasses many things but its basic premise is that it pits ""the people"" against ""the establishment."" <br/><br/>It can be from the left, in which case it's usually purely class-based (think Bernie Sanders, or go back to Huey Long!) or it can be from the right in which case it's got a class component but also a xenophobic one that blames not only the elites, but also foreigners/minorities etc. <br/><br/>That is to say, different so-called ""populist"" movements define who is ""the people"" and who is ""establishment"" differently, but that central, vigorous antagonism is always there and it always arises when there is either inequality or a sense of national humiliation. Sometimes it's absorbed into the existing parties (as FDR did with HUey Long) and sometimes it overcomes them and becomes hideously authoritarian (interwar Europe.)<br/><br/>I hope that helps.

1493729237,"As a Democrat, I completely disagree with the NYT editorial board. I don't see why there should be some sort of liberal litmus test that denies capitalistic instincts. In fact, I always thought conservative attacks on the Clintons for what they commanded at certain events was unfounded and hypocritical. If the market values an Obama or Clinton or Bush speech at a million dollars, than so be it. Anyone who rises to a level of high office will command significant money after leaving it. One could argue that some of the money earned should be set aside for charity, or a certain number of speeches should be given pro bono, as at a commencement address. Otherwise, I don't think Obama is out there to set some kind of example by declining money for publishing or speaking at planned events. Don't forget that Obama's success was largely due to his understanding of community organizing to get donations at the grassroots level. Hillary was overly driven by corporate entanglements, which made her ground game less effective than Obama's.

Why else do you think that he and Michelle chose to acquire a very expensive house in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington DC, the most exclusive neighborhood in that city?  So now he's cashing in on his status as ex-President to make millions in book deals and many more dollars giving speeches.  <br/><br/>Bernie Sanders, ""man of the people,"" is no different.  People get focused on the reported income on his tax statements and forget all the very lucrative financial perks that come with being a member of Congress. Sanders' tax return showed income of only a little more than $200,000 for 2014 but the senator's expected retirement benefits make his situation much more comparable to those in the millionaire class he faults.  Moreover, the vast majority of Americans don't realize that Senators have their travel expenses paid for in full by taxpayers whenever they go on congressional delegation trips to anywhere in the world. Having lived and worked in DC and dated a legislative aide, I learned how all the Congressmen plan trips of one kind of another under the guise of congressional business.

He has earned access to the wealthy. As a private citizen who does not come from inherited wealth, he needs to earn a living to support himself, his family, and the good works he will undoubtedly do in his post-presidency. <br/><br/>As a speaker, one sets one’s fee based on the value that the speech brings to the audience as well as to the ability of those extending the invitation to pay. In my mind, $400K for a speech to Wall Street may undervalue the influence that Mr. Obama may have on his audience. He is not betraying his values, but shows his understanding of what others value. <br/><br/>However, let’s talk about values.

1493693478,"I agree with the editors about the cost of former President Obama accepting $400K for a private speech before financial executives.  Just because other presidents have done the same thing only makes Mr. Obama's decision more costly.  He was a president of great moral rectitude--and many of us hunger for such leadership now more than ever. This is not racism; this is the hope of concerned citizens, who recognize the extraordinary nature of this moment and the importance of leaders rising above business as usual.  Mr. Obama's decision to accept this sum from bankers when millions of Americans are understandably cynical about the motivations of their public servants calls into question--however slightly--the integrity he established so consistently as president. In doing this, he also (inadvertantly) demeans those who look to him for inspiration to walk the higher road.  Many presidents have understood this--in and out of office.  Lincoln, for example, refused to let the White House butcher save the choice cuts for the first family, saying it would not do for him to eat the best meat when his soldiers were hungry.  President Carter has devoted his energies to building houses for poor families and other vital humanitarian causes.  No one is asking the Obamas to forego great wealth now that he is no longer president; and there is no question they will have this.

1493670919,"For those of you who are critiquing us for critiquing Obama, here is why it matters. Let me try to address the common comments:<br/><br/>Why critique only Obama about paid speeches?<br/>Nice strawman, the answer is: we shouldn't; we should not have allowed this practice probably ever. It just so happens that now is a critical point in American history, and the role of special interests in politics is increasingly under fire. For Obama to do this is to give credibility to those who would call him and/or the system corrupt - so really, this is a rhetorical issue. This system is corrupt - he might not be - but he isn't helping his case. And please, don't claim that its because he's black that we are asking he not do this speak, that only weakens your point and clearly you haven't learned from the election if your saying that.<br/><br/>Who is this speech hurting?<br/>Everyone. Imagine if someone told you if you do them a favor now, you can make a lot of money, easily, later. Revolving door jobs, speeches, etc. This speech, just like the Clinton's and other previous president's speeches, is harmful because it allows for a casual quid pro quo system to take root - that hurt's everyone except the special interests in question. Trump will get these offers, especially if he helps some friends out...My point is, the words don't really matter - its the (reality of perception of a) transaction (particularly regarding private speeches).<br/><br/>Plus, presidents get great book deals - do they need these speeches?

His legislative record in Illinois was, and remains, a testimony to his courage, or lack thereof.

It is easy (and lazy as my mom would say) to look at the world as black and white; in simplistic terms.  Barack was raised up because he too spoke in slogans and rallied through visceral, cheerleading terms.  He was given a peace prize for the simplistic belief that enthusiasm can change the world.  David Brooks once noted that he could understand Donald, Bernie, and Barack because they had simple rallying cries that people could understand.  Brooks could not understand Hillary because her message was complicated - it takes extremely hard work, study, and incremental steps (often very small and some to the other side and even backward to gain broad sustainable support) to make lasting change for the better.  We elect Knights in shining  armor who speak as heroes who valiantly slay the dragon and then we find out they are real people and our little hearts are crushed.  Maybe we should hire a real person to lead whose message is that  life is hard, complicated, and victories don't come with fanfare but come an inch at a time with sweat and effort.  We don't need a knight to lead us, we need someone who works hard, doesn't care about photo ops, who focuses on the next generation, and can endure - basically a mom.

A majority are still mesmerized with the good ol' American Dream of being part of that 1% themselves. I'm afraid this proves the old saying that people get the government they deserve —in this case, one where politicians talk down on corporate wealth when they want to get elected, but take it with both hands outside office.  Their principles then are a suit they wear to work, not something they live day to day in their personal lives. This defines hypocrisy. More specifically, the Obama administration was much criticized for stocking government positions with former Goldman Sachs employees at a time when banks had thrown the economy into deep peril by corrupt practices. A president doesn't need to take a job at a bank to enjoy the revolving door between politics and corporations.  $400,000 for a speech is a cozy enough arrangement.  Let's face it, Obama had a double side to him, one that was humanitarian and liberal, another that was allied to the rich, militarily a hawk and oppressive towards whistle-blowers.

Do the math – it’s not hard to understand – it’s staring you in the face, but too many people choose to ignore it because it upsets their own worldview or their sense of identification with all these beautiful people.  We have Trump because Obama did not live up to his “brand,” nor did the DEM Party that he “leads.” Read Thomas Frank if you want to understand what’s been happening.  Obama pulled the mask off the whole rigged system for anyone to see if they were honest.  He’s doing now what he’s always done – taking care of his friends and neighbors and future employers.  HRC and Bill did the same (and GWB etc.)  The DEMS are just as corrupt as the GOP – face it.

1493650273,"Thank you for this editorial. I respect, admire, and miss President Obama. I believe that he will fare well in history when historians consider the circumstances in which he took office, and the challenges he faced as the first African-American president in a nation where racism, explicit or unconscious, runs deep. This, however, is a bad move. The invitation is a way for the Wall St. firm to draw potential clients, using the president as an ad pitch. President Obama must think carefully about who he speaks to, in what settings, and for what compensation. For settings like these, he might give the money directly to non-profit organizations. Is this a double standard for an African-American president? No, I don't think so. It is a reflection of the political urgency of our times. Hillary Clinton was damaged by the justifiable perception that she was too cozy with the financial industry. The wealth gap is the largest in recent history. President Trump's policies will aggravate it. Republicans have skillfully mobilized voters around the charge that Democrats are culturally and economically out of touch. Our political system is in danger; the Democrats are the only viable alternative; they have to mobilize a public and be willing to change the economic landscape. Friends, don't turn this into a Sanders/Clinton replay: move on, it's a bigger issue.

Otherwise, we get what we have now which is an oligarchy. Obama is just putting fuel to the fire here - if he really wanted hope and change he would be a Jimmy Carter, not a Bush or a Clinton.

We are no longer a democracy, but a plutocracy, with unlimited opportunities for those connected to Washington, and not so much for the rest of us. This is what both parties have devolved into---- rewarding those in power (and their best friends) at the expense of every other taxpayer.  A quick scan of the net worth of members of Congress will show just how different our elected officials are from most working American men and women. The conflicts of interest in source of income for our elected officials are numerous and frequently quite scandalous.
