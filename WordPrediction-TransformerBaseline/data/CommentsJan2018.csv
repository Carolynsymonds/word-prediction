The economy is indeed doing well, but Mr. Trump hogging the credit was like when someone else builds a skyscraper and the guy who puts up only the spire claims that he built the tallest building. But then we do not expect any different from a narcissist. Trump talked about building the wall but Kennedy talked about knocking down the economic and social walls separating people that are now higher because of Trump’s incendiary rhetoric. Kennedy’s speech was somewhat less polished but the sincerity, lack of hyperbole and his youthful enthusiasm to seek solutions from an all-inclusive America was refreshing. Also, the American people applaud the bravery of invited guests and share in the loss of those who faced tragedies. However, Trump’s attempt to bask in reflected glory of invited guest was pathetic.  Trump made a good attempt to seem congenial and compassionate, yet his tweets and tactics of the last one year made clear that his STOU was nothing else but sugar coated pandering to the base.

And we read the justifications of our good sense in not watching, by the journalists, who, throughout trump's mendacious and narcissistic rant, drew our attention to all the con artistry that we are so familiar with. Most of us who did not watch did not do so simply because we ""do not like"" trump, but because our health is adversely impacted by new treachery piled on top of already-existing treachery.

The single most important source of water storage in California is the snow pack, not reservoirs.  Regardless of the causes of climate change, it is and will be affecting our frozen water supply.  Rain creeps higher into the mountains more often every year.   If subtropical storms become more frequent and dump rain at higher elevations, then reservoirs will need to be kept lower to accommodate snow melt and avoid flooding. <br/><br/>Pretending there is and will be predictable water supplies into the future is not sensible. It will vary greatly from year to year as the state experiences years of drought mixed with years of heavy, but likely warm precipitation.  <br/><br/>Additional storage can be part of a solution, but the problem is too large to solve in that fashion alone. The agricultural sector needs to do smart business planning when deciding if it is a prudent investment to plant thousands of acres of trees or other crops that require a certain amount of water annually. Unfortunately, there is not an honest exchange of information around the issue, meaning we will end up responding to a crisis as they are in Cape Town rather than preventing one.

Your points: (1) Trump came across as normal last night; (2) it's when we treat Trump as normal that he's least effective; (3) he revels in the circus; (4) we should treat him more like a bad president and less like a cartoon villain. In other words, we should focus on what he does – and, if I may add, what the rest of the GOP does - rather than speculating about his IQ or mental health or other character flaws. Making fun of Trump's personality and even physical traits may feel cathartic, but it is fodder for his base and excuses the rest of the GOP.  An example is Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment.  While we were sharing memes that poked fun at his base (comments which, by the way, misinterpreted what she said), his base was using it as a rallying cry – proof of our contempt for them and more reason to vote for Trump. <br/><br/>And may I suggest the problem is not the Democratic leadership?

Trump’s Wall is forecast to cost billions with only small, marginal impact in immigration, more so to the extent it is the wall he promised. <br/><br/>Straining budgets for healthcare, education, veterans, defense, and even shutting down the government to harass a tiny minority of young people reveals cruelty and investment out of proportion to any problem most Americans face. It takes so much investment and pain to expel all of these people because, at the human level, people integrate into communities and build lives together. We’re Americans, and mostly immigrants.<br/><br/>Add to this the absurd effort to strip healthcare from millions of Americans to save certain companies and wealthy people tax money, and the tax cut that mainly paid the 1% investor class, and it’s apparent that our government is run by a minority, for a minority. That minority just hates immigrants and wants to pay less for programs that help the rest of us.<br/><br/>Likely the shutdown highlights this argument, but the GOP had majorities in every branch of government but needed Dems to vote for their budget (because some Reps would not).

When I'm not doing that, I'm reading about, tweeting about, or watching gymnastics. When I say that my life revolves around gymnastics, I mean it.<br/><br/>Gymnastics is hard. It is physically and psychologically tough. I struggled with both aspect. I had many injuries. I struggled with anxiety and mental blocks. I think that's why I started coaching, and why I love coaching and empowering girls so much.<br/><br/>I am fortunate to have met hundreds of truly amazing, passionate, well-meaning people through the gymnastics community. Everyone I know is as horrified as the rest of the world. My heart breaks for every child who has been abused through gymnastics, and it hurts me very deep in my heart to see that the sport I love has been tainted by a select few people. The majority of gymnastics professionals do NOT condone any kind of abuse and reject the kind of ""old-school"" abusive coaching tactics that enabled a predator like Nassar to thrive. I have worked at two gyms and both have had safety protocols in place LONG before it was mandated or suggested.

Nassar was one of the main factors that I was able to continue to pursue gymnastics after several injuries. I developed an online acquaintance with Nassar at the age of 14 when I injured my ankle at a meet and reached out for help from him when financial hardships made it nearly impossible for me to receive proper physical therapy to resume training. When the IndyStar story first broke, I remember feeling shocked and confused. I didn’t want to believe that the “doctor” that I had briefly come to know, could do such a thing. Later learning that he abused over 100 gymnasts, including those who I looked up to while growing up, I was mortified.<br/>	Seeing all the opportunities that USAG and others had to stop/prevent this horrendous abuse is sickening. I’m not only angry, but conflicted. I don’t think that this should negatively affect the thousands of current, innocent gymnasts and all their hard work by “shutting USAG down.” However, ALL of Nassar’s enablers need to be held accountable. The removal of board members and the shutdown of The Ranch is just one tiny step in the right direction. The abusive culture that as been brewing within the sport needs to change. There are so many good people out there fighting for change. USAG needs to step up, work alongside them, LISTEN and TAKE ACTION.

Some of the girls that testified were girls I'd watch compete since they were preteens; realizing that this happened to girls I felt like I knew, and that were so young made me realize I had a responsibility to start asking questions at my daughter's gym. She's not yet two years old. I thought I had more time before I had to ask coaches about policies regarding being alone with a gymnast.

Well, as it turns out the rates of hospitalizations for pneumonia climbed, studies showed that you could prevent pneumonias by treating bronchitis with antibiotics, and the administrators had to reverse their intimidation.  The media didn't take up the task of directing blame for all the preventable pneumonias because administrators in this culture are not criticized.

It does so faster than those designing the systems realize.

As Nassim Taleb and Benoit Mandelbrot have pointed out, lots of 'accidents' are more likely than most think because they are outliers that obey power-law distributions and do not follow classic (and boring) normal curve distributions.

His career brought him into contact with the first men of his time; he preferred the company of rustic ignoramuses. It was hard to believe, watching him at Dayton, that he had traveled, that he had been received in civilized societies, that he had been a high officer of state. He seemed only a poor clod like those around him, deluded by a childish theology, full of an almost pathological hatred of all learning, all human dignity, all beauty, all fine and noble things.

1517358468,5a708d4710f40f00018be7e8,5067,"In my humble opinion the idea of America – equal opportunity for all – is at stake under the Trump administration's economic and immigration policies and initiatives. This idea takes shape in many contexts. In the context of economics, there has been a growing trend in our politics that replaces Adam Smith’s concept of self-interest guided by the “invisible hand” of “moral sentiments” with exclusionary selfishness.<br/><br/>If Adam Smith were alive today he would agree that our economy should work for our mutual self-interest, not for some of us but for all of us. This ideal has driven not only the hardest working but also some of the smartest people to our shores. It gave us a “competitive advantage” over other nations of the world.<br/><br/>The nativist movement in American politics today, however, is discouraging immigrants to come to America. We are in danger of becoming an arrogant, unwelcoming America.

But the US already has far and away the greatest number of immigrants of any country in the world and presumably many of the recent immigrants here now are passing on those low wage jobs as well.

The actions of each of the two leading separatist parties is more profitably viewed this way.

And it's not like they need to get elected so they can improve their social or financial standing, like so many in public positions who use the revolving door to move from their public jobs to more lucrative private sector work or K Street.

They are looking for the low-hanging fruit, how to ""save"" money by managing the health expenditures of the healthy young people who work for them.<br/>What we really need is an Expanded Medicare program, for the unlucky people, who are  not yet on Medicare, but who are actually a lot sicker than most of the people who are on Medicare.

My son may choose Kaiser (offered by his employer), my daughter will get direct coverage under her maritime training program. My cost will drop to about $3,600 (medicare and HMSA) when I retire (can't cover my kids any more). My wife will choose either Kaiser or HMSA when she retires.<br/><br/>Just bought 10 more shares of AMZN @ $1,422.76.

Health care access should not be tied to employment. People need health care before they are old enough to work. People need health care when they are too sick to work. More and more people are not working as employees. And most of the health care expense is generated by people who are past the point of working.<br/><br/>I think it would be helpful to ban employers from buying or providing health insurance as a compensation benefit for employees. Start from that premise and design a system that is available to all without putting any at a disadvantage based on how they support themselves or what their medical history has been. Pool the risks instead segmenting and resegmenting them.<br/><br/>Many of the common and expensive health risks facing people today are the result of the way big business has transformed our food, polluted our environment, and introduced health disrupting substances into products we use and are surrounded by every day.

For over 50 years, insurance companies increased premiums every year to satisfy stockholders, however employees and employers that paid for the service didn’t feel the loss because it wasn’t revealed in paychecks. As premiums increased, so did the ability for providers to charge more because they were not actually billing the patient directly. When provider costs went up, so did the premiums and on went the out of control spiral until the 1990’s when millions began dropping out because of the cost and families went bankrupt from one illness.<br/><br/>Secondly, Obamacare is only a stepping stone to the ultimate solution – Medicare for all. The only way to kill the hungry tapeworm is to reduce cost through price controls. Of course the AMA, insurance companies, for-profit hospitals, big pharma, and a long list of tapeworms, will fight tooth and nail to keep their untouchable status.

Your biggest problem in that sentence is the phrase ""deductible plans"". See when a hospitably say is publicly operated, it costs 'X'. When it's ran by a for profit company, it costs 'X + profits'.<br/><br/>Just like that you've driven up the cost. Now private claims it can do things cheaper but how do you suppose that is done? Cut employees? Less nurses and doctors is going to drive up wait times. No emergency department so as to avoid costly interventions? Common, but problematic when you're in trouble.<br/><br/>Efficiency is a common buzzword, and I'll admit it's anything other than a buzzword when freedom of information laws grant me access to and thus oversight of running costs of a private company. Less maintenance is common, but again not ideal when it comes to healthcare.<br/><br/>There is nothing a private company can do that public can't do better and cheaper. The biggest problem a lot of people have is that they aren't approaching this objectively, it's an ideological war on all things public in more than a few countries, and that has a bigger impact than any cost control.

Venezuela has already collapsed and Iran is seeing social unrest. All due to the loss of oil revenue. Since revenue losses are projected to continue into the foreseeable future, Iran and Russia are on target for major social unrest as their budgets get squeezed.
