Most Republican solutions to poverty exude contempt for people in poverty and usually manage to enrich those who already have.  Democrats have overplayed their hands and created solutions which created problems as well as solved them.  With the Affordable Care Act, they did some good things, but tried to use Republican ideas to create free market solutions which the public didn't perceive as free market.  The public mistook the rising premiums of health insurance as a product of Obamacare rather than as a continuation of the rising cost of health care, even at a reduced level of increase.  At any rate, the rising cost of premiums is making healthcare again unaffordable.

They opposed it because Obama proposed it, even though it had every conservative principle in it (market based, only needs based subsidy all private carriers competing, no government option, etc.) and it was actually a prop up of the failing status quo of private health care financing in the.US--private insurance was collapsing in a death spiral prior to its passing.  So either they repeal it as they have promised and own the collapse of the status quo and millions of uninsured or they betray their constituents and leave it in place.  I am a retired health care executive and it is going to be amusing to see their dilemma evolve.  They richly deserve this for their history of ignorance on health policy matters and blind opposition to anything Obama proposed.  This will be a case of ""if they are viewed as breaking it, they now own it"".   I think folks will judge them harshly for whatever they do.

The agreement to pull all the troops out of the overturned hornets nest of Iraq (the 'bad war') that now everybody berates him for was widely accepted at the time. His mistake was to think he could cleanly extricate the US from the 'good war' Afghanistan - and leave it a better place. But what was the real blunder (but it placated the Demo Party hawks and the GOP mainstream) was the imperial overreach of using drones to' takeout terrorist leaders' and in the process killing or maiming whoever else was nearby.

It won it on the backs of Islamic fundamentalists, such as the Afghan Mujahadeen and Arab and Chechen foreign fighters, who flocked to Afghanistan and promptly received CIA weapons training to ""bleed the Soviets"" for the U.S. When the Islamic fundamentalists surprisingly succeeded, the U.S. abandoned Afghanistan to OBL, Pakistan, and to the CIA trained foreign fighters. This created more chaos. These entities used the lawless and chaotic Afghanistan to develop extremist beliefs and ideologies and start training in global terrorism. 9-11 was really no surprise to many pro-Western Afghans, like Ahmed Shah Massoud, who repeatedly sought U.S. intervention in the early 1990s, to offset against the rise of Islamic extremism in Afghanistan and the region.  These repeated requests for U.S. intervention then fell on the dear ears of American politicians and advisers.  Trump should not rely on past advisers on Afghanistan since the bulk of American advisers know about Afghanistan after 9-11.  U.S. needs those advisers who officially asked USG to intervene and redevelop Afghanistan in 1990, like myself and many others whose voices are drowned by the thousands of so called Afghan experts at USAID, DoS, DoD, who say they know what to do.

The smarter Bush (George HW), recognized the risk during his presidency, and made the decision not to push the Gulf War further to take out Saddam Hussein, because it would ""create a dangerous power vacuum"". But GHWB was absolutely right. GW, is not as wise as his father, and regrettably listened to the more sinister voices (Cheney, Rumsfeld, etc.) from his father's administration, and destabilized Iraq. The sad reality of Iraq, and much of the middle east, is that those countries represent a lose assemblage of factions hostile to each other, forced to co-exist by prior (Western) treaties. An uneasy peace within those artificially imposed borders exists only when there is a brutal, oppressive leader at the top. This is not the US ideal of a utopian democracy, but at least it keeps the bloodshed to a minimum. As we have seen with the elimination of Saddam in Iraq, and the subsequent, ousting of leaders in the ""Arab Spring"", things become very messy when the leadership is suddenly removed. <br/><br/>Afghanistan:things went terribly for the British empire and Russia when they tried to intervene there; and Russia has a stronger stomach for going ""all-in"", militarily, than the US.<br/><br/>Once you intervene militarily, in that part of the world, there is no graceful exit.

There is nothing he can do to dispute that fact.<br/>   And the latest war against ISIS he owns 100%. He pulled out of Iraq way to early, made no attempt to leave troops in Iraq to stabilize it and then had to essentially reoccupy the country.

We could have removed Sadaam Hussain in 92, but didn't. We could have cultivated a viable opposition to Sadaam among the Iraqi middle class, but instead chose a policy that virtually destroyed that class and their potential as political actors.<br/><br/>We could have removed Ben Ladin in 2003, declared mission accomplished and left Afghanistan. But we shifted vital troops from that mission to Iraq and then spent the next eight years looking for Ben Ladin only to find him living under Pakistani protection. Yet we continued to build up troop deployments to Afghanistan.<br/><br/>When one looks at these flawed judgments, one after another, one can only conclude that our best minds are in a fog or that there are other strategic issue at play that we the people are not privy to.

So, clearly one should remember all the myriad ways the USSR fought the cold war.  The invasion of Georgia should have been a wake up call to the NATO allies.  The weak response was followed by Crimea, Syria and the US elections.  I think the NATO allies had better be prepared for another military adventure in early February as well as the continued onslaught of psyops.  Sanctions, expelling 35 agents and closing leisure facilities is hardly proportional to the recent aggressions.  So, they will continue.

We were driving home from his elementary school in a middle-class, suburban neighborhood and cars were briefly slowing ahead of us.  Walking on a sidewalk was a thin, disheveled man clutching belongings in a bag, and wearing too loose pants that drooped and partially exposed his bare buttocks; he was a transient who must have ridden a bus beyond the urban area where the homeless are more commonly found.  My son said, ""Pull over and stop the car mom, I want to help him!""  My son leapt out of our car with cash I gave him. He approached the man, out of my hearing range, and chatted with him while taking off his school uniform belt, then helping thread it through the man's pants loops, and buckling it-  buttocks no longer exposed, and handed him the small amount cash I had given him (all I had with me.) The man walked with my son back to our car, leaned in the window and said, ""Bless your son.""  As we drove off, my son quietly stated, ""I wanted him to have some dignity."" My son went on to graduate from a Jesuit high school and university (where he served breakfast at a homeless shelter every Saturday morning starting a 7:00 am), then served two years in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, assisting vulnerable populations after graduation. He has astronomical student loans to pay back, but his education was worth every penny for the ""Man for Others"" he became.

They didn't want to burden one person or one business so they were calling several to put together enough.  He asked firmly ""What does he really need!"" Finally they answered. My friend put together everything; Winter coat, cord pants, underwear, socks, sweater etc.  He brought it all home and here's the lesson. His son, then about 14 years old saw what he brought home. He asked about it and was told. My friend was upset when his son said, ""Dad, so much! You given away so much!""  Follow me said the father and they walked upstairs to his son's room.

I am a '78 Holbrook HS grad where half of my classmates were Navajo Indians living in dormitories hundreds of miles from their families. Not surprisingly, they did poorly in school and almost none went to college.<br/>Much of my early years were intertwined with the Navajos. My father owned a small Indian jewelry store where, as a teenager,  I was the ""expert"" lapidarist crafting beautiful torquioise cabachons from rough rock. We would trade and sell silver and semi-precious stones to the Indians and I even became a pretty good ""Indian"" jewelry maker myself.<br/>It pains me to say that nearly every weekend I would see a drunk Indian passed out on a sidewalk or alley. I never really had an Indian friend.<br/>I left Holbrook at age 17 heading east and never looked back. As a young man it seemed much too difficult to affect any change in the dying town or to help the Navajos. Now, nearly 4 decades later, living across the country with my own family and understanding the challenges of life and the tremendous financial and emotional support my kids require my outlook has changed. Where once I was scornful, I now feel profound sadness and some guilt (I suppose for not having done more to help and for an inherited ""American"" embarrassment over how they have been neglected and treated).<br/>My hope is that someone can help these beautiful people become better integrated into American society while maintaining their cultural heritage.",20966987.0,20966987.0,<br/>,comment,1483380996,1.0,0,0,Sports,0.0,,20966987,https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png,1,13,,2,,Pro Basketball,0,approved,1,0,1483394001,Bill Julien,66353366.0,"Parkland, FL",,,News

I remember it was the place to be come game night.  Lines would form in the early morning for those valuable tickets.  By the time the boys varsity game would start, the stadium was full and rocking.  The Window Rock Scouts stadium became known by locals as the Thunder Dome.<br/><br/>I remember sitting in the locker room getting ready to come out was an experience onto itself.  You could hear the growing crowd, feel the thundering stomps of feet and the cheering noise of the fans.  What an experience.  <br/><br/>But to get to that game night experience, one had to endure the late night practices in the quiet, empty stadium.  Due to the sharing of the gym with the freshman, junior varsity and varsity boys and girls teams, there were quite a few late practices.  so, homework and studying had to be done many times just after school.  <br/><br/>The reservation is a hard place to grow up.  Unemployment is high.  Running water and electricity not s given for everyone.  For me, being half Navajo and half Irish didn't help.  But sports provided an avenue for me to grow.

His initial assertion that he'd married too young but had loved Helen at the time is a falsehood. His hypocritical counselling of his daughter over her victimisation of a friend, and his assertion to her grandparents that he wanted to raise children with real values is laughable. It makes it hard to believe that he'd only ever bedded 3 women, and that he'd remained true to Helen for all those years until he met his wounded soul mate in a diner. Instead of the sincere POV we believed we were watching, it was instead the manipulations of a conman with a hidden agenda, burdened by secrets and mental anguish. All the lies, deceit and disloyalty make perfect sense. Nobody can be a true friend or sacred partner when everything they say or do is rooted in a lie. It's odd that Sarah Treem originally spoke of her hero as someone who believes he deserves the best and expects it, and yet she now portrays him as self destructive, in search of punishment. This must be a personality disorder I am unaware of.<br/><br/> I think most people yearn for a happy ending. This bleak show is never going to pander that desire.

In episode 5, we learned of his complicity in his mother's suicide, a story retold this week to Martin. But now Noah has a surrogate in the form of Nina, previously a reluctant but ineffective supporter; now she bares her teeth and terrifies Helen, who is no match for that animal ferocity. In fact, Helen's WASP core is exposed as ugly and shallow: her ignorance of Noah's brokenness comes as a complete surprise. She cannot be real  and take the risk of revealing the truth, so she runs. But we know that Helen is running for her life.<br/>         We also see the commonalities between her and Noah. She calls Max for validation and the chance to punish him too; these two are practiced at the art of sado-masochism. Helen's the sadist, playing her part as well as Noah might.  Perhaps even better: Noah always felt like a stumbler, lurching toward sensation, driven by pain, whereas Helen capitalizes on the pain she causes.<br/>        I agree that the Gunther subplot is tedious, at least as it's currently unfolding. I'm hoping that Brendan Fraser gets more to work with in the coming weeks. But he and Vic are hamstrung characters. Juliette, however, is not; why, then, does she not have more savoir faire than to get huffy when Noah turns away? Surely she should have a more worldly take.

Popping pills and confessing to all that your matricide is dangerous territory – few will forgive that.

Helen is marvelously unaware that her attractiveness to men stems from her wealth and connections, and still thinks she is the darling of her college scene at 45. She longs unhappily for the life she once had – a world where she was the central character around which all others revolved. I do admire her iron clad manners in the face of all insults. Juliette epitomizes the European view that Americans are all sexually liberated, and surprised by the reality.<br/>Noah is not a violent murderer – vehicular homicide is viewed as a careless accident in NY, not usually subject to jail time. Noah had to confess in court to go to jail for this. And secondly Allison, who plays the wounded bird card better than anyone, is sly but not smart. If she looked into NY law, she would realize that it is Noah who has the most rights to Joanie, not Cole. Being a felon who has served their time does not negate parental rights.

1483486783,5869d08f95d0e03926078980,1146,"<br/>“With another happy relationship thrown in her face, she did the natural, narcissistic thing.”  “We know the answer—narcissistic!”<br/>I don’t think that’s the answer—though Nina seems to think so. But since when did Noah’s sister become the truth-teller here? No one’s a truth-teller on<br/> this show. And Nina’s working through her own issues—e.g. class resentment--when she explodes at Helen. <br/><br/>When spouses split up, they often ask “what exactly have we been doing all these years?” That isn’t because they’re narcissists. It’s because marriage is complicated. Newlyweds have a rosy view of each other; they present their best selves for a long time and do a series of adjustments throughout the marriage—except that they also have to deal with jobs, children and other stresses. So they miss a lot and start following a story in their heads, rather than what the marriage really is. You describe this, but narcissism isn't the explanation. Just this season, Noah tells Helen he doesn’t want her coming to the prison (Helen: Didn’t he sacrifice himself for me, doesn’t he love me?) Nina makes her doubt the marriage even more.

Mining him for info right afterwards was DUMB, but her motives are complex because she’s human. <br/><br/>“Narcissistic” is too easy. “The Affair,” for all its troubles, is better than that.",20965610.0,20965610.0,<br/>,comment,1483368799,1.0,0,0,Culture,0.0,,20965610,https://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/apps/timespeople/none.png,0,13,,2,,Television,1,approved,1,0,1483486783,marion dee,23466976.0,new york,,,Review

Their rhetoric is that having a job by itself is good for Americans. But what both of them and the economists don't realize is that people don't work because it is good; they work because they need to survive, i.e. for money. It doesn't help if you get a job that doesn't pay a living wage - you don't get a job just because you want to tell your friends you have a job.<br/><br/>The unemployment statistic is only important for the capitalist class, because it is an index of labor productivity and exploitation.

Mr. Obama is running around doing everything he can in his last weeks to insure his legacy (what a laugh that term becomes), trying all kinds of last-minute efforts to screw up Mr. Trump's taking the reins of government, yet the Times says nothing about that, except maybe that he should have done something sooner. Right-wingers screamed (and perhaps rightly so) when Mrs. Obama claimed that with one of her husband's 'accomplishments' she had for the first time been proud to be an American. Mr. Obama's and Mr. Kerry's recent betrayal of Israel has left me, at a rather late age, ashamed to be an American for the first time in my life. Yet the Times approved their (non-)action at the U.N.

Corporations had no problem with Trump's red herring position since it diverted just enough rust belt voters away from seeing the real problem: a non-union service based economy that has permanently replaced assembly line jobs and guarantees underemployment with lower average wages. There are plenty of non-union lower paying available jobs at Walmart and other businesses. Walmart-like jobs that have salaries much lower than a traditional manufacturing job will continue. Trump supporting rust belt worker failed to attribute any of the higher paying manufacturing jobs to labor's ability to collectively bargain with profit making corporations. The manufacturing jobs will return at some point but the salaries will be consistent with those in developing markets (see Southeast Asia). In the meantime, focus is on Trump returning those jobs to Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania while the thought of unionizing private sector service based jobs continues to appear no where in the political discourse of these rust belt states. The realistic option for the unemployed/underemployed of the rust belt states where Trump succeeded in selling the Brooklyn Bridge should be on a method to increase wages for those service based jobs.

Banks, for example, compete for customers by offering special deals (the value of which customers are not in a good position to assess) rather than lower loan rates and higher rates on deposits.

We already have people in the conservative media debating whether or not we can ever know that something is really ""true"" or ""not true"". (Maybe millions of people did vote illegally. . . You can't prove it didn't happen! Etc.) And we have Trump undermining government, including the national security apparatus, when it does not suit him, which further consolidates power and feeds the cult of personality. Just as importantly, a fascist needs to have power over major corporations in order to Marshall their support in the implementation of policy and message. Trump knows money is power. Why would a corporation disagree with Trump's public assertions, knowing he is willing to undermine their business? (I should say, Why would money-grubbing corporations disagree . . .? There are many humane businesses and corporations out there, just not enough). I don't believe Trump is ""following"" a fascist's playbook; rather, I think fascism is the natural outgrowth of someone with Trump's personality: insecure, vengeful, a megalomaniac, possibly a sociopath, plus a lot of other things. When he becomes President, he will have the military at his disposal.

Yes this would contradict his and certain cabinet members' beliefs that only coal, natural gas, and oil should be used to produce electricity and keep the nation warm or cold. But perhaps when he realizes that he cannot provide jobs for coal miners he could find excuses for the following:<br/><br/>1) A national program to inform, encourage, and set in motion a program to install heat-pumps in every location that needs a new system for heating and cooling. This would require a national increase in the number of qualified technicians. Ground-source geothermal heat-pump systems would also require drillers and system installers.<br/><br/>2) A national program to inform, encourage, and set in motion a program to end the practice of landfilling, state by state, replacing that practice by using solid waste as a natural  resource to produce hot water and/or electricity. Food waste is separated and becomes biogas as fuel for vehicles. <br/><br/>Since the New York Times never, yes never, mentions these technologies, Trump would not be recommending doing anything the Times recommends.

As a physician assistant I have coached many people with diabetes and pre-diabetes. Most of may patients can't set up a gym in their office and install a new fridge full of vegetables along with a blender.  They work on assembly lines, in office cubicles, and at cash registers.  Their work time is governed by clocks and supervisors who are not always open to the idea of them going out for a 5 min walk every hour or doing their work on a stationary bike.  Most people have job restrictions, heavy family obligations, stretched finances, and precious little time. This is the reality that most people with DM2 face. A story about an impossible overhaul does little to help these people.  Of more use is ideas on how to weave exercise and better food choices into already hectic and stress filled lives. If you work in a safe neighborhood, leave home 10min early and park a 10 min walk from the office door. That forces 20min of walking a day and also gives a person time to mentally transition to and from work life. Talk about how to not get too hungry.

Overproduction (much, animal and vegetable, is exported), overuse, and ignorance in production, preparation, etc., these are all problems and all important parts of the puzzle.<br/><br/>Anyone who believes that a vegetarian world would not have very similar problems of overproduction, soil degradation, runoff, chemical/biological pollution, etc., is simply not thinking things through.<br/><br/>As for one's diet though, whatever works works. But my diet of lots of fruits and vegetables includes pork and lamb too, and it does no one any harm (locally raised).<br/><br/>(And for the comment I'm sure to get about ""no harm,"" I say look to that carrot and ask yourself if you speak its language, if you truly know that once living thing, now dead in your hand, feels nothing, knows nothing.

It is absolutely critical for health, especially in this atmosphere of sugar and sodium-laden foodstuffs in which we all are immersed, that everyone learns how to cook from scratch as much as is feasible. Produce doesn't have to be expensive or organic, only fresh. Meals don't need to be elaborate or expensive affairs, there are thousands of delicious recipes online that begin and end with using dried beans, simple whole grains, and fresh produce.

On the field, he was one of the all-time greats.<br/><br/>Should the writers, for reasons of their choosing, make him wait for the honor? I guess so, sure. I don't know why Joe DiMaggio didn't get in the first time, or Al Simmons. Whether because of steroids or for any other reason, a player may fail to get in on the first vote. But Bonds should not be kept out forever.<br/><br/>When did Bonds begin using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs)? The article doesn't say, and I have never gotten an answer from anyone. I suppose it's fair to assume he benefitted from them for 30% of his career - or more.<br/><br/>I believe he is entitled to be judged (in terms of on-field contributions) on the basis of his accomplishments before he used PEDs. And during that period, he was a team player, a smart player, and an alert player.<br/><br/>Bonds, for example, won 8 Gold Gloves for his defense. Fans who are older than I am have told me that Bill Mazeroski and Brooks Robinson deserve their Hall of Fame plaques based on defense. Mazeroski also won 8 Gold Gloves. Bonds won 8 in a span of 9 years.<br/><br/>What about other areas of his game? Where does he stand on the all-time list for successful stolen-base attempts? Did he get thrown out more often as a Giant than as a Pirate? What about grounding into double plays, as opposed to batting in runs via sacrifice fly? He swung the bat many times, but I think his stats reveal a prime situational hitter.<br/><br/>Put him in.",20969085.0,20969085.0,<br/>,comment,1483414043,1.0,0,0,Sports,0.0,,20969085,https://s3.amazonaws.com/pimage.timespeople.nytimes.com/2642/4636/cropped-26424636.jpg?0.7210743734340215,1,2,,0,,Baseball,0,approved,1,0,1483449737,MTF Tobin,26424636.0,Manhattanville,,,News

Baseball is a game of deception. Many players took that to the process of preparing their bodies for the game. Until the rules for testing caught up, they were engaged in a process as old as the game, doctoring the ball, taking amphetamines, lifting the glove on a trapped ball, setting up outside the plate, stealing signs, and on and on. Selig should have insisted on drug testing, he did not. The players took advantage as did the managers. The fundamental fact is that Bonds and Clemons were the best of their era. They obviously faced opponents that were juiced like them. No one can prove that other players of that era who have entered the Hall of Fame regardless of their hallowed reputations or denials did not use performance enhancing substances. There was no testing. We should judge athletes by how they performed against there opponents in the era in which they competed within the rules as they were enforced. Having a rule and not enforcing it on a player until their career is over makes as much sense as waiting to reverse calls of the phantom force outs at second base during a double play until the end of the game because someone complains that the rule wasn't enforced.

I see two major points that need to be considered with regard to the steroids in baseball issue. First, the measure of success is performance in the game/sport. Second, it's myopic to think that only the acknowledged or preeminent athletes deserve punishment.<br/><br/>If the league didn't see a problem with Bonds' (or anyone else's) steroid use, and it is obvious that they didn't at the time, then how/why would the HoF try to abide by a different standard? MLB sets the standards and officiates the game. The voting for the HoF needs to be based on statistics and facts, not feelings. If MLB wanted to punish a steroid user they could invalidate his career statistics, for example. That's what the Tour de France did with Armstrong's wins.<br/><br/>The other huge problem with punishing steroid users now, years after the fact and outside the rules of MLB, is that the impact of the steroid use would extend far beyond the individual users. For example, anyone hitting before Barry Bonds in 2001 would be the (perhaps) innocent beneficiary of a steroid-induced great year. In fact, a quick look at Rich Aurilia shows that he hit 50 points higher in 2001 than his career average.

The truth is that the existing health care resources in the USA were diluted by the ACA because more individuals became insured.  No one denies this as it is a recent event.  Because more people have access to health care it has undeniably been diluted.  As a result, accessibility has worsened for everyone, this too is a fact; not a political opinion.  As resources have become stretched, more midlevel providers have joined the ranks of providers.  This means that seeing a midlevel is not the same as seeing a medical doctor.  Therefore not only has the accessibility been reduced but the quality as well.  Another example of this is the time physicians and midlevels are willing to spend with the patient/visit.  These are  examples of what has happened to everyone that already had health insurance before ACA.  Additionally health insurance premiums have all gone up to varying degrees- none have decreased.

Rather, he only prolonged it, and that will not be thought of as a good thing. In the developed world, market-priced medical care still exists only in the USA.<br/><br/>The USA is the last holdout with market-priced medical care not only because of any inherent conservative or free market ideology. Rather, as the wealthiest nation that ever existed we are the last ones who can afford it.<br/><br/>The reason that no nation, including the wealthiest can allow markets to set the prices of medical care indefinitely is that demand for medical care is inelastic. Demand for a good or service is inelastic if a percentage increase in price results in a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity demanded. Basic economics tells us that sellers facing inelastic demand will continuously raise prices until prices reach the elastic portion of the demand curve. Consequently in every developed country in the world, all goods or services with inelastic demand have their prices regulated by government.

Most people who are employed get subsidized health insurance as a benefit of employment.  Those health premiums are paid for partly by the tax deductions that companies get for providing them, and partly by the increased prices of goods and services that companies charge to recoup the costs.  Either way, we pay.  We just don't recognize this virtual ""tax"" because it is invisible.

I spent time in the army and did a tour in Iraq. I now work as an analyst. I can understand people's frustration with the government work force, but I don't think the problem will be solved by gutting the the federal work force. I believe people make the wrong assumption that we are inefficient and lazy and we have the greatest benefits in the world. This is an absolute generalization and so, it is false( ok, except the benefits). We have good benefits, when you compare them to the private sector. But, does anyone else think this is where the discrepancy remains? I worked as a geologist for a while and yes, I had no rights and job security. Of course it sucks! You work longer hours with no change in pay or benefits. But, that is the very problem. It's not that most federal employees are over compensated and worthless. It's that most Americans in the private sector are overworked and under compensated. Why? Because there are no rights for people! The direction should not be attacking the federal work force.

One pool consists of analysts and designers who identify and clarify challenges, create response strategies and systems to address those, and relate behavior to performance. The second pool are the operators whose attention to day-to-day matters help to assure agencies function effectively yet have the stand-by capabilities to ramp up when needed. Most of the Center for Disease Control operations are routine although highly technical but it needs the capability to address unknown diseases during an epidemic. What keeps these capacities efficient are the middle managers constantly confronting the balance between the routine and the exceptional, the familiar and the new. Donald Trump has some familiarity with the operational needs of the real estate and entertainment industries but how well does he understand the relationship between direct service clinical personnel in the V.A. and the management of outreach services vs. records control? How will a hiring freeze affect departmental IT units compared to public information services? What Trump seems to want is a reduction in service effectiveness so there are fewer audits of high net worth individuals or inspectors to make sure fecal matter is not included in ground meat at your supermarket.
