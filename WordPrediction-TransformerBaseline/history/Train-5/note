🔵 TRain 4
Prediction:

“the investigation of his lawyer...”
➤ Shows coherent, topic-consistent continuation: “investigation”, “lawyer”, “personal business dealings”

Top-3 predictions:

['the', 'it', 'american']
➤ Reflects general political/news domain tokens, likely because of the diverse scale of training examples

🟡 Train 5
Prediction:

“would rather fly with a competitor...”
➤ More specific or idiosyncratic continuation, possibly from memorization or overfitting

Top-3 predictions:

['would', 'alarms', 'will']
➤ Less stable/general predictions. "alarms" is notably out-of-context, suggesting lower semantic grounding
